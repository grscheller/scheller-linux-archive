# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## The Project

The project consists of the scheller-linux-archive GitHub repository, its
associated GitHub community infrastructure, and any Wiki pages associated
with this repo. The project maintainer is Geoffrey R. Scheller.

## Purpose of Project

The primary purpose of this GitHub repo is to capture what the project's
maintainer learns in a way that helps him stay up to speed on topics related
to software development and system administration in Linux/Unix/Posix
like environments.  Additional infrastructure is maintained to help the
mantainer document what he has done.  Secondarily, it is hoped that this
additional infrastructure makes the content of the repo more accessible
to others.

When topics mature to the point where there may be interest in share
collaborative open source development, the maintainer may spin these topics
off into their own projects/repositories/communities with appropriate community
codes of conduct.

## Community Standards

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, political persuation, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of behavior contributing to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of derogatory, crude or sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project Maintainer responsibilities

The project maintainer is responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The project maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that a reasonable person would
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope of Community

This Code of Conduct applies basically to the project maintainer and whomever
uses the GitHub infrastructure available to GitHub users in regards to the
scheller-linux-archive GitHub repo. Geoffrey Scheller is the only individual
who represents this project. Examples of representing a project or community
include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online
or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the maintainer at geoffrey@scheller.com. The maintainer
will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that he
deems appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct was edited down from the default boilerplate provided by
GitHub, which itself is based on the
[Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.
