# Contributing

This GitHub repo helps me organize, prioritize, and stay up to speed
on a variety of software development and system administration topics.
It is primarily focused on Linux and other POSIX like environments.

I use this repo to maintain my less mature personal software
development projects.  As such, this repo has many loose threads.
As subtopics mature, I will spin them off to their own repos.

I make the archive available to others as a public service.
If you wish to point out an error or suggest an improvement,
please drop me an e-mail at geoffrey@scheller.com.  That
said, you are still welcome to use any supported means GitHub
provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to provide me feedback.
