Basically the whole scheller-linux-archive GitHub repo are my personal notes I
take for myself and make available to others as a public service.  If you wish
to point out an error or improvement, dropping me an e-mail at
geoffrey@scheller.com would be the most appropriate means of letting me know
of your suggestions.  That said, you are still welcome to use any supported
means GitHub provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to provide me feedback.

As subtopics mature and become of greater value, I may spin these off as
separate GitHub repositories, not just separate branches.

The first of these may be my implementation of the fpinscala project which
works through the exercises in the book "Functional Programming in Scala"
by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.  While the project's purpose is just
to document my learning of Functional Programming with Scala, as a separate
project it would avoid the clutter of the rest of the repo.  If I actually
come up with code of utilitarian benefit to the Open and/or Libre Scala
Communities, I'd spin these off as separate repos with an Open Source
development model.

As one may notice, I make frequent commits and plenty of comments both
in my code and my GIT history.  I find this useful in documenting the
evolution of the code and my thinking.  I like to make successive
"git diff's" useful and am not afraid of showing all my "dirty laundry."
Being able to reverse engineering the scaffolding is sometimes more
useful than seeing the finished product in all its glory.
