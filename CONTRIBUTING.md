Basically this GitHub repo is my personal software development
archive for Linux and other POSIX like environments.  Its primary
purpose is to permanently capture what I learn in a way that
helps me stay up to speed on a variety of topics.  The act
of maintaining this repo helps me organize and prioritize
my various personal software development projects.

I make the archive available to others as a public service.
If you wish to point out an error or suggest an improvement,
please dropping me an e-mail at geoffrey@scheller.com.  That
said, you are still welcome to use any supported means GitHub
provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to provide me feedback.

By its nature, this repo has many loose threads due to the whim
of my interests.  I put a lot of effort in maintaining useful
README.md files.  I find this practice useful in documenting
the evolution of the code and my thinking.  If some subtopics
matures to the point where there would be serious interest in
collaborative development, I would consider creating a separate
GitHub repo for it, with appropriate permissive and/or libre
source licenses for the effort.

As one may notice, I make frequent commits and plenty of comments
both in my code and my GIT history.  The main branch is my working
branch which I pass between several systems.  I like to try not to
group unrelated changes together.  This may result in showing some
"dirty laundry" along the way, but being able to reverse engineer
the scaffolding is sometimes more useful than just showing a
sequence of "ingenious" steps.
