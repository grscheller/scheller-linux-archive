This GitHub repository helps me stay organized and up-to-speed
on a variety of software development and system administration
topics.  Currently, it is targeted toward desktop Arch Linux
laptops and workstations.

If you wish to suggest any improvements, or point out any
errors, please let me know via GitHub issues, pull requests,
or more informally by emailing me at geoffrey@scheller.com.
