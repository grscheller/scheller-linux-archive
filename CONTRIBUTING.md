This GitHub repo helps me organize, prioritize, and stay up to speed
on a variety of software development and system administration topics.
It is primarily fucused on Linux and other POSIX like environments.

This repo gives me a place to maintain my less mature personal
software development projects.  As such, this repo has many
loose threads.  I put a lot of effort in maintaining useful
README.md files.  I find this practice useful in documenting
the evolution of the code and my thinking.  As subtopics
mature, I will spin them off to their own repos.

I make the archive available to others as a public service.
If you wish to point out an error or suggest an improvement,
please drop me an e-mail at geoffrey@scheller.com.  That
said, you are still welcome to use any supported means GitHub
provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to provide me feedback.
