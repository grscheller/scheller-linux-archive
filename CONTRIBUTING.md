Basically the whole scheller-linux-archive GitHub repo are my personal notes I
take for myself and make available to others as a public service.  If you wish
to point out an error or improvement, dropping me an e-mail at
geoffrey@scheller.com would be the most appropriate means of letting me know
of your suggestions.  That said, you are still welcome to use any supported
means GitHub provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to provide me feedback.

By its nature, this repo has many loose threads due to the whim of my
interests.  If some subtopics matures to the point where there would be serious
interest in collaborative development, I would consider creating a separate
GitHub repo for it, with the Open and/or Libre Source licenses appropriate
for the effort.

As one may notice, I make frequent commits and plenty of comments both
in my code and my GIT history.  The main branch is more my working branch
and less the release branch of a software project.  I also put a lot of
effort in maintaining useful README.md files.  I find these practices
useful in documenting the evolution of the code and my thinking.  I like
to make successive "git diff's" useful and am not afraid of showing some
"dirty laundry." Being able to reverse engineer the scaffolding is sometimes
more useful than seeing the finished product in all its glory.
