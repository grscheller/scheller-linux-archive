Basically this GitHub repo is my personal software development
archive for Linux and other POSIX like environments.  Its primary
purpose is to permanently capture what I learn in a way that
helps me stay up to speed on a variety of topics.  The act
of maintaining this repo helps me organize and prioritize
my various personal software development projects.

I make the archive available to others as a public service.
If you wish to point out an error or suggest an improvement,
please dropping me an e-mail at geoffrey@scheller.com.  That
said, you are still welcome to use any supported means GitHub
provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to provide me feedback.

By its nature, this repo has many loose threads due to the whim of my
interests.  If some subtopics matures to the point where there would be serious
interest in collaborative development, I would consider creating a separate
GitHub repo for it, with an Open and/or Libre Source licenses appropriate
for the effort.

As one may notice, I make frequent commits and plenty of comments both
in my code and my GIT history.  The main branch is more my working branch
and less the release branch.  I also put a lot of effort in maintaining
useful README.md files.  I find this practice useful in documenting the
evolution of the code and my thinking.  I like to make successive
"git diff's" useful and am not afraid of showing some of my
"dirty laundry" along the way.  Being able to reverse engineer the
scaffolding is sometimes more useful than seeing the finished product
in all its glory.
