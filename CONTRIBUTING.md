Basically the whole scheller-linux-archive GitHub repo are my personal notes I take for
myself and make available to others as a public service.  If you wish to point out an
error or improvement, dropping me an e-mail at geoffrey@scheller.com would be the most
appropriate means of letting me know of your suggestions.  That said, you are still
welcome to use any supported means GitHub provides (Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to
provide me feedback.

As subtopics mature and become of greater value, I may spin these off as separate GitHub
repositories, not just separate branches.

The first of these may be my implementation of the fpinscala project which works
through the exercises in the book "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and
Runar Bjarnason.  Still, the project's purpose is just to document my learning of Functional
Programming with Scala, but would avoid the clutter of the rest of the repo.  If I actually
come up with code of utilitarian benefit to the Open and/or Libre Scala Communities, I'd
spin these off as separate repos with an Open Source development model.
