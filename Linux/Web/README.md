# Private Home Page

## Used in lieu of browser bookmarks.

* Personal home page for my bookmarks and password schemas.
* Keep content (html) and style (css) as separate as possile.
* Don't want to have to "sync" password schemas between my various<br>
  browsers and computer systems.
* Set homepage in browser to ~/info/Web/homepage.
* I push these files to my various Linux and Windows systems I use at work.
* See [linuxHome](../../linuxHome/) project to see how I push these to my
  various Linux systems.

## Files:
### [homepage.html](homepage.html)
* Information content.
* Basically an HTML table organizing topics.
* Kept very simple to facilitate "monkey see-monkey do" updating.
* Easily resized with Ctrl= and Ctrl-.
* CtrlShift+ and CtrlShift_ also work to resize.

### [homepage.html](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/grscheller/scheller-linux-archive/blob/master/info/Web/homepage.html)
* Above rendered as HTML.

### [style.css](style.css)
* All formating done here.
* Optimize for my vision problems - dark background.

### [Portmanteau](Portmanteau.html)
* Contains password schemas.
* Organized as a column table, which I am not happy with.
* Intend to change to a row table, or just a text file, so that<br>
  the "records" for each sites kept together.
