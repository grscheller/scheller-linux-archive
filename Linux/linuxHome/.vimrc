" A simplistic .vimrc file.  Its existence also prevents
" vim when run in a terminal from hijacking the mouse from
" the terminal emulator.  I don't want vim moving its cursor
" based on the mouse.  I want the terminal emulator to
" handle copy and paste with the GUI environment.  When I
" right-click, I want the terminal emulator menu.
