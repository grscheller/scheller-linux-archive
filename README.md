# scheller-linux-archive
My personal software development archive for Linux and Linux
like environments.  The primary purpose of this GitHub repo
is to permanently capture what I learn in a way that helps me stay up to
speed on a variety of topics.

## Grokking Computer Languages:
### C and C++:
#### [old school unix](grok/oldSchool)
* Best practices for pre-1990 imperitive programming techniques

### JVM Languages:
Projects whose basic purpose is for me to learn a variety computer
languages.  Allows me to more quickly pick up the threads where I
left off and not have to learn everything all over again from scratch.
#### [functional programming in scala](grok/grokScala/fpinscala/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than the
  Scala language per say.

#### [learnScala](grok/grokScala/learnScala)
* Document factoids about the Scala language
* Illustrates a hierarchical SBT Scala build

#### [functional programming for mortals](grok/grokScalaz/fpForMortals/)
* Scala project working through the book
  "Functional Programming for Mortals with Scalaz" by Sam Halliday.
* A collecton of standalone scalaz projects for purposes of learning scalaz.

#### [grokJava](grok/grokJava/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala perspective
* Post Java 8 oriented

### Haskell:
#### [haskell intro programming](grok/grokHaskell/haskellIntroProgramming/)
* Working through examples and exercises from the Univ. of Chicago's
  honors introduction to programming course sequence.

#### [haskell parallel and concurrent](grok/grokHaskell/haskellParallelAndConcurrent/)
* Implementing examples inspired by Simon Marlow's book
  "Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell."

### Rust:
#### [learnRust](grok/grokRust/learnRust)
* Learn Rust as a systems language
* Learn Rust as a general purpose programming language

### Python:
#### [pureMath](grok/grokPython/pureMath/)
* A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic
* An old project of mine back when I first learned Python
* Example of code being both Python 2.7/3 compatible

#### [deep learning with python](grok/grokPython/deepLearning/)
* Code written while learning Python based Deep Learning
* Keras and TensorFlow libraries

#### [pythagorean triples](grok/grokPython/pythagTriples/)
* Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples
* Mathematical factoids about Pythagorean triples
* Also used to help me learn Haskell stack

## Linux Configuration & Administration:
### [linux info](linux/info/
A fairly free form collection of information on a variety
of topics relating to Linux/Unix/POSIX software development,
environment configuration, and system administration.
#### [Unix Commands](linux/info/UnixCommands.txt)
* General Unix/POSIX command line utilities
* Using SSH without password

#### [Bash Notes](linux/info/BashInfo.txt)
* My personal Bash notes/cheatsheet

#### [GIT Notes](linux/info/GITnotes.txt)
* Pretty much everything I know about GIT
* These are the notes I take while learning GIT
* I adapted these notes to share with my coworkers

#### [Vim Notes](linux/info/vimNotes/README.md)
* Everything I know about VIM (VI-iMproved)
* Configuring VIM to play nice in a hybrid CLI/GUI workflow
* Configuring VIM plug-ins with Vundle plugin manager

#### [Unicode Cheatsheet](linux/info/UnicodeCheatSheet.txt)
* Useful code points

#### [Arch Linux Info](linux/info/ArchLinuxInfo/)
* Contains Arch Linux specific information

#### [CentOS 6 For the Unempowered](linux/info/CentOS6Info/README.md)
* CentOS 6 without root privaledges
* Building GCC compiler chain and Haskell Stack in home directory

#### [Windows 10 Powershell Configuration](linux/info/Win10PowershellConfigFile)
* File location: `Documents\WindowsPowershell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
* Powershell GUI made to play nice with dark themes
* Powershell context colors "turned off."  Very useful
  when overhead projectors don't render colors well.

### [bashEnvConf](linux/bashEnvConf/)
Documents how I configure my Linux environment.
* Example Bash configuration files
* Simple, ~/bin bash scripts illustrating bash scripting techniques
* ~/.vim/vimrc configuration files (including Vundle and Syntastic)
* ~/.inputrc to configure GNU readline library
* ~/.xinitrc and ~/.xprofile files for X desktops

### [My Arch Linux Admin Logs](linux/ArchLinuxAdminLogs/)
Documents changes made when administrating my Arch Linux system.

These files are date ordered and evolutionary in nature.  These logs
save having to re-research howto's from scratch
#### [ArchLinux_AdminLog](ArchLinux_AdminLog)
* Documents system administration on my Arch Linux laptop
* Cronologically ordered
* Lots of factoid asides

#### [Haskell_Adminlog](Userland_Adminlog)
* Initially only using the Stack tool.
* Starting to grok using locally installed Haskell via Cabal.

#### [Python_Adminlog](Userland_Adminlog)
* Initially tracked Anaconda Python installed by unprivalleged user.
* Now using Arch Linux's Python infrastructure.

#### [buildGHConArchLinuxLog](buildGHConArchLinuxLog)
* Documents my steps building the Glasgow Haskell Compilation System on Arch
* Built from Github source
* Build relies heavily having a current Haskell tool chain already installed

## WWW Info
World Wide Web factoids and utilities.
### [WWW Info](web)
#### [private html homepage](web/homepage)
* In lieu of using bookmarks
* Easily shared between browsers/computers, not shared with Google or Mozilla
* [homepage.html](web/homepage/homepage.html): information content (html)
* [style.css](web/homepage/style.css): style (css) formatting done here
* Resize in browser with `<ctrl>+<+>` and `<ctrl>+<->
