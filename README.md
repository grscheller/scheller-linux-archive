# scheller-linux-archive

Contains notes on topics regarding Linux utilities,
environment configuration, and system administration.
Also included are software projects that have been
useful to me learning software development topics.

The primary purpose of this GitHub repo is to capture what
I learn in a way that helps me stay up to speed on a topic.  
I try to maintain additional infrastructure so that this
information may be of some marginal use to others.

## info directory:

This directory is a fairly free form collection of text
files with information on a variety of topics.

  1. Arch Linux System Admin Notes
  2. CentOS6 for the unempowered (no root)
  3. GIT notes
  4. Bash environment configuration
  5. SSH configuration
  6. Vim notes
  7. Private HTML Homepage 
  8. Bash scripting

## Software projects:

### 1. bash-utils -
    * Simple, but utilitarian, bash scripts illustrating bash scripting
      techniques.  I put these in my ~/bin directory.

### 2. fpInScalaBook -
    * Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
      "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
      This project is more about learning Functional Programming than
      the Scala language per say.

### 3. grockScala -
    * Document factoids about the Scala language, so that I don't have
      to rediscover most of what I forget.

### 4. pythagTriples -
    * Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples.  As
      much about the mathematics of Pythagorean triples as it
      is an exercise to learn Haskell stack.

### 5. matlab -
    * Matlab and Mupad projects.

### 6. pureMath -
    * A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic
      written in Python.  An old project of mine back when I
      first learned Python.  

### 7. linuxHome -
    * The infrastructure I use at work to keep my Linux 
      environment synced accross the half dozen workstations I use.

### 8. javaGrock -
    * An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala
      perspective.
