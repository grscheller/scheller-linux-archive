# scheller-linux-archive
My personal archive of my personnal software development projects
and related information.

The primary purpose of this GitHub repo is to capture what I learn
in a way that helps me stay up to speed on a topic.  I maintain
additional infrastructure so that this information may be of some
marginal use to others.

## [info](info/) directory:
This directory is a fairly free form collection of
text files with information on a variety of topics.

1. Arch Linux System Admin Notes
2. CentOS6 without root privs
3. GIT notes
4. Vim notes
5. Bash environment configuration
6. SSH configuration
7. Private HTML Homepage 
8. Windows 10 Powershell and Cygwin configuration

## Software projects:
### 1. [bash-utils](bash-utils/)
* Simple, but utilitarian, bash scripts illustrating bash scripting techniques.
* I put these in my ~/bin directory.

### 2. [fpinscala](fpinscala/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than the
  Scala language per say.
* In this project I try to do both.

### 3. [grokScala](grokScala/)
* Document factoids about the Scala language

### 4. [grokScalaz](grokScalaz/babySteps/)
* Document factoids about Scalaz.
* A hierarchical scalaz project for purposes of learning scalaz.

### 5. [fpForMortals](grokScalaz/fpForMortals/)
* Scala project working through the book
  "Functional Programming for Mortals with Scalaz" by Sam Halliday.
* A collecton of standalone scalaz projects for purposes of learning scalaz.

### 6. [grokJava](grokJava/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala perspective.
* Not exactly sure the direction this project will take.

### 7. [grokRust](grokRust/)
* Learn Rust as a systems language.
* Learn Rust as a general purpose programming language.

### 8. [haskellIntroProgramming](grokHaskell/haskellIntroProgramming/)
* Working through examples and exercises from the Univ. of Chicago's
  honors introduction to programming course sequence.

### 9. [haskellParallelAndConcurrent](grokHaskell/haskellParallelAndConcurrent/)
* Implementing examples inspired by Simon Marlow's book
  "Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell."

### 10. [linuxHome](linuxHome/)
* Keep Linux environment synced across workstations and supercomputers.
* Based on the infrastructure I use at work.

### 11. [pythagTriples](pythagTriples/)
* Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples.
* Mathematical factoids about Pythagorean triples.
* Also used to help me learn Haskell stack.

### 12. [pureMath](pureMath/)
* A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic.
* An old project of mine back when I first learned Python.
