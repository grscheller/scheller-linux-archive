# Geoffrey Scheller's Archive

This is my "mosh pit" of Linux notes, my "homepage" of links, system
admin & development logs, and computer language playground.

* [Personal Notes](notes/)
* [Personnal Homepage](web/)
* [System Admin Logs](adminLogs/)
* [Grokking Computer Languages](grok/)

By its very nature, this repo contains many loose threads.
