# scheller-linux-environment

So they may be of some marginal use to others, and that they
are always easily available to me, I have created a Github repo
to capture my Bash/Unix environment configuration.  Also
included are notes I have taken while learning software development
and linux system administration.  These include administration 
documenting the steps I did to create an Arch Linux system.  Some
example software projects are included in the devel directory.

I will set up this project as if it were a regular user's home
directory.  My intention is not to provide a comprehensive set
of production ready, idiot proof utilities.  Nor is it to write
polished, handholding tutorials.  Instead, I just wish to 
capture what I learn in a way that helps me stay up to speed on
a topic.
