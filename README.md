# scheller-linux-archive
My personal software development archive for Linux and Linux like
environments.

The primary purpose of this GitHub repo is to capture what I learn
in a way that helps me stay up to speed on a topic.  I maintain
additional infrastructure so that this information may be of some
marginal use to others.

## Linux Configuration & Administration:
### [linux info](linux/info/)
This directory is a fairly free form collection of text files with information
on a variety of topics relating to Linux software development, environment
configuration, and system administration.

1. Arch Linux System Admin Notes
2. CentOS6 without root privs
3. GIT notes
4. Vim notes
5. Bash environment configuration
6. SSH configuration
7. Windows 10 Powershell and Cygwin configuration

### [bash utilities](linux/bash-utils/)
* Simple, but utilitarian, bash scripts illustrating bash scripting techniques.
* I put these in my ~/bin directory.
* For some useful shell functions, see the .bashrc files in
  [linux/info/BashEnvConf](linux/info/BashEnvConf).

### [linuxHome](linux/linuxHome/)
* Keep Linux environment synced across workstations and supercomputers.
* Based on the infrastructure I use at work.

### [private html homepage](linux/Web)
* In lieu of using bookmarks.
* Easily shared between browsers and computers.
* Not shared with Google or Mozilla.

## Grokking Computer Languages:
Projects whose basic purpose is to teach me a variety of mostly functional
computer languages.
### [functional programming in scala](grok/grokScala/fpinscala/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than the
  Scala language per say.

### [learnScala](grok/grokScala/learnScala)
* Document factoids about the Scala language
* Illustrates a hierarchical SBT Scala build.

### [functional programming for mortals](grok/grokScalaz/fpForMortals/)
* Scala project working through the book
  "Functional Programming for Mortals with Scalaz" by Sam Halliday.
* A collecton of standalone scalaz projects for purposes of learning scalaz.

### [haskell intro programming](grok/grokHaskell/haskellIntroProgramming/)
* Working through examples and exercises from the Univ. of Chicago's
  honors introduction to programming course sequence.

### [haskell parallel and concurrent](grok/grokHaskell/haskellParallelAndConcurrent/)
* Implementing examples inspired by Simon Marlow's book
  "Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell."

### [learnRust](grok/grokRust/learnRust)
* Learn Rust as a systems language.
* Learn Rust as a general purpose programming language.

### [grokJava](grok/grokJava/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala perspective.
* Not exactly sure the direction this project will take.

### [Old School](grok/OldSchool)
* Best practices for pre-1990 imperitive programming techniques.

### [pureMath](grok/grokPython/pureMath/)
* A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic.
* An old project of mine back when I first learned Python.
* Example of code being both Python 2.7/3 compatible.

### [Deep Learning with Python](grok/grokPython/deepLearning/)
* Code written while learning Python based Deep Learning.
* Keras and TensorFlow libraries.

## Educational:
Projects of interest other than illustrating programming techniques.
### [pythagorean triples](educational/pythagTriples/)
* Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples.
* Mathematical factoids about Pythagorean triples.
* Also used to help me learn Haskell stack.

### [harmonic oscillator wave function](educational/harmonicOscillator/)
* Models a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator wavefuntion.
* Mupad notebook, requires MATLAB & MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox.
