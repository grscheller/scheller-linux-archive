# Geoffrey Scheller's Linux Software Development Archive
My personal software development archive for Linux and Linux
like environments.  The primary purpose of this GitHub repo
is to permanently capture what I learn in a way that helps
me stay up to speed on a variety of topics.  The act of
maintaining this repo helps me organize and prioritize my
various software development interests.

## Linux Configuration, Tools & Administration:

### [Bash Environment Configuration](linux/bashEnvConf/)
Documents how I configure my Linux/POSIX environments.

### [Linux Notes](linux/notes/)
Collection of information on a variety
of topics relating to Linux/Unix/POSIX software development,
environment configuration, and system administration.

### [My Arch Linux Admin Logs](linux/ArchLinuxAdminLogs/)
Date ordered log files documenting changes made when
administrating my Arch Linux system.


## Grokking Computer Languages:

### [C and C++](grok/oldSchool)
Systems and application programming with C and C++.

### JVM Languages:
Projects whose basic purpose is for me to learn a variety computer
languages.  Allows me to more quickly pick up the threads where I
left off and not have to learn everything all over again from scratch.

#### [functional programming in scala](grok/grokScala/fpinscala/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than the
  Scala language per say.

#### [learnScala](grok/grokScala/learnScala)
* Document factoids about the Scala language
* Illustrates a hierarchical SBT Scala build

#### [functional programming for mortals](grok/grokScalaz/fpForMortals/)
* Scala project working through the book
  "Functional Programming for Mortals with Scalaz" by Sam Halliday.
* A collecton of standalone scalaz projects for purposes of learning scalaz.

#### [grokJava](grok/grokJava/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala perspective
* Post Java 8 oriented

### Haskell:
#### [haskell intro programming](grok/grokHaskell/haskellIntroProgramming/)
* Working through examples and exercises from the Univ. of Chicago's
  honors introduction to programming course sequence.

#### [haskell parallel and concurrent](grok/grokHaskell/haskellParallelAndConcurrent/)
* Implementing examples inspired by Simon Marlow's book
  "Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell."

### Rust:
#### [learnRust](grok/grokRust/learnRust)
* Learn Rust as a systems language
* Learn Rust as a general purpose programming language

### Python:
#### [pureMath](grok/grokPython/pureMath/)
* A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic
* An old project of mine back when I first learned Python
* Example of code being both Python 2.7/3 compatible

#### [deep learning with python](grok/grokPython/deepLearning/)
* Code written while learning Python based Deep Learning
* Keras and TensorFlow libraries

#### [pythagorean triples](grok/grokPython/pythagTriples/)
* Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples
* Mathematical factoids about Pythagorean triples
* Also used to help me learn Haskell stack


## WWW Info:
World Wide Web factoids and utilities, including a private old fashioned
homepage.
