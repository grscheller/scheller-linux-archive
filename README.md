# Geoffrey Scheller's Linux Mosh Pit

Collections of stuff not worth their own GitHub repositories.

* [Linux Notes](notes/): Linux/Unix related personal notes &amp; factoids
* [System Admin/Software Development Logs](adminLogs/): to help me keep track of what I've done
* [Personnal Homepage](web/): in lieu of using browser bookmarks
* [Grokking Computer Languages](grok/): place to commit scratch code

By its very nature, this repo contains many loose threads.
