# scheller-linux-archive

Contains notes on topics regarding Linux utilities, environment<br>
configuration, system administration, Also included are software<br>
projects that have been useful to me learning software development<br>
topics.

The primary purpose of this GitHub repo is to capture what I learn<br>
in a way that helps me stay up to speed on a topic.  I try to<br>
maintain additional infrastructure so that this information may be<br>
of some marginal use to others.

## [info](info/) directory:

This directory is a fairly free form collection of<br>
text files with information on a variety of topics.

1. Arch Linux System Admin Notes
2. CentOS6 for the unempowered (no root)
3. GIT notes
4. Bash environment configuration
5. SSH configuration
6. Vim notes
7. Private HTML Homepage 
8. Bash scripting

## Software projects:

### 1. [bash-utils](bash-utils/)
* Simple, but utilitarian, bash scripts illustrating bash scripting
  techniques.
* I put these in my ~/bin directory.

### 2. [fpInScalaBook](fpInScalaBook/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises
  in the book "Functional Programming in Scala"
  by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than
  the Scala language per say.
* This project trys to do both.

### 3. [grockScala](grockScala/)
* Document factoids about the Scala language, so that
  I don't have to rediscover most of what I forget.

### 4. [pythagTriples](pythagTriples/)
* Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples.
* As much about the mathematics of Pythagorean triples
  as it is an exercise to learn Haskell stack.

### 5. [matlab](matlab/)
* MATLAB and MuPad projects.

### 6. [pureMath](pureMath/)
* A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic
  written in Python.
* An old project of mine back when I first learned Python.

### 7. [linuxHome](linuxHome/)
* Based on the infrastructure I use at work to
  keep my Linux environment synced across the
  half dozen workstations which I use.

### 8. [javaGrock](javaGrock/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala
  perspective.
