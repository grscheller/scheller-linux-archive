# scheller-shell-utilities

So they may be of some marginal use to somebody, and that they
don't die with me, I have created a Github repo of some Bash
Shell utilities and environment configuration files.

I will set up this project as if it were a regular user's home
directory.  My intension is not to provide a comprehensive set
of production ready, idiot proof Bash shell scripts.  Instead,
what I provide are simple scripts that provide useful utility
and illustrate shell programming techniques in an understandable
way.

My originally exposure to Unix shell scripting was with the
Korn Shell while a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T
during the late 1980's and early 1990's.  I didn't obtain
any sort of proficiency until the late 1990's when I did
software configuration management at Lucent Microelectonics,
soon to become Agere Systems.  Currently, I am a research
scientist at Air Force Research Laboratories where I help
fellow scientists and engineers refactor MATLAB and Python code.
I am also a Functional Programming enthusiast/hobbiest trying
to wrap my brain around Haskell and Scala.
