## GRScheller's Linux Mosh Pit of Notes &amp; Other Miscellany

Personal notes and other stuff not worth their own GitHub repos.

* [Notes](notes/): notes and factoids
* [System Admin Logs](adminLogs/): mostly Arch Linux focused
* [Tooling Logs](toolingLogs/): software development tooling setup
* [Grokking Computer Languages](grok/): place to commit scratch code
* [Course Work](courses/): for online courses I am taking

By its very nature, this repo contains many loose threads.
