# scheller-linux-archive
My personal software development archive for Linux and Linux
like environments.  The primary purpose of this GitHub repo
is to permanently capture what I learn in a way that helps me stay up to
speed on a variety of topics.

## Grokking Computer Languages:
Projects whose basic purpose is for me to learn a variety computer
languages.  Allows me to more quickly pick up the threads where I
left off and not have to learn everything all over again from scratch.

### [functional programming in scala](grok/grokScala/fpinscala/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than the
  Scala language per say.

### [learnScala](grok/grokScala/learnScala)
* Document factoids about the Scala language
* Illustrates a hierarchical SBT Scala build

### [functional programming for mortals](grok/grokScalaz/fpForMortals/)
* Scala project working through the book
  "Functional Programming for Mortals with Scalaz" by Sam Halliday.
* A collecton of standalone scalaz projects for purposes of learning scalaz.

### [haskell intro programming](grok/grokHaskell/haskellIntroProgramming/)
* Working through examples and exercises from the Univ. of Chicago's
  honors introduction to programming course sequence.

### [haskell parallel and concurrent](grok/grokHaskell/haskellParallelAndConcurrent/)
* Implementing examples inspired by Simon Marlow's book
  "Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell."

### [learnRust](grok/grokRust/learnRust)
* Learn Rust as a systems language
* Learn Rust as a general purpose programming language

### [grokJava](grok/grokJava/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala perspective
* Post Java 8 oriented

### [old school unix](grok/oldSchool)
* Best practices for pre-1990 imperitive programming techniques

### [pureMath](grok/grokPython/pureMath/)
* A mathematics library centered around integer arithmetic
* An old project of mine back when I first learned Python
* Example of code being both Python 2.7/3 compatible

### [deep learning with python](grok/grokPython/deepLearning/)
* Code written while learning Python based Deep Learning
* Keras and TensorFlow libraries

### [pythagorean triples](grok/grokPython/pythagTriples/)
* Haskell project that generates Pythagorean triples
* Mathematical factoids about Pythagorean triples
* Also used to help me learn Haskell stack

## Linux Configuration & Administration:
### [linux info](linux/info/)
This directory is a fairly free form collection of information
on a variety of topics relating to Linux software development,
environment configuration, and system administration.

1. Unix Commands (including passwordless SSH)
2. Bash notes
3. GIT notes
4. Vim notes
5. Unicode cheatsheet
6. Arch Linux Info
7. CentOS 6 Info
8. CentOS 7 Info
9. Windows 10 Powershell and Cygwin configuration

### [bashEnvConf](linux/bashEnvConf/)
* Examples `.bash*` and other user configuration files
* Simple, utilitarian bash scripts illustrating bash scripting techniques

### [My Arch Linux Admin Logs](linux/ArchLinuxAdminLogs/)
* Contains date ordered admin logs documenting the steps taken
  to create and administer Arch Linux on a laptop.
* Saves having to re-research howto's from scratch

### [private html homepage](web)
* In lieu of using bookmarks
* Easily shared between browsers and computers
* Not shared with Google or Mozilla
