# Geoffrey Scheller's Linux Mosh Pit

Collections of stuff not worth their own GitHub repositories.

* [Linux Notes](notes/): personal notes primarily Linux/Unix related
* [System Admin/Software Development Logs](adminLogs/): to help me figure out what I did
* [Personnal Homepage](web/): in leiu of using browser bookmarks
* [Grokking Computer Languages](grok/): place to commit scratch code

By its very nature, this repo contains many loose threads.
