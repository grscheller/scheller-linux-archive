# Geoffrey Scheller's Linux Mosh Pit of Notes &amp; Other Miscellany

Collections of stuff not worth their own GitHub repositories.

* [Linux Notes](notes/): Notes &amp; Factoids
* [System Admin Logs](adminLogs/): Mostly Arch Linux focused
* [Tooling Logs](toolingLogs/): Software development tooling setup
* [Grokking Computer Languages](grok/): place to commit scratch code
* [Personal Bookmark Page][1]: Now on GitHub Pages

By its very nature, this repo contains many loose threads.
