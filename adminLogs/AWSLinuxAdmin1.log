Purpose: Steps taken to configure an AWS EC2 instance as a
         development environment.  Since this is a work related
         system, I have to be a bit dodgy about some of the details.
         As such, I won't go into the AWS Console steps needed
         to create this system.

         AWS Linux seems to be a Redhat derivative.

  Add a user with sudo privaleges (see 3rd entry below)

    # useradd -c"Geoffrey Scheller" -m geoff
    # usermod -aG wheel geoff
    # yum install git -y

2020-03-05:
  Configure GIT

    # su - geoff
    $ git config --global user.name "Geoffrey.scheller"
    $ git config --global user.email geoffrey.scheller.1@us.af.mil
    $ git config --global core.editor vim

  Install my GitHub repo

    $ mkdir ~/devel; cd ~/devel
    $ git clone https://github.com/grscheller/scheller-linux-archive
    $ cd scheller-linux-archive
    $ git config user.email geoffrey@scheller.com
    $ git config user.name grscheller

  Install my common Linux environment

    $ cd ~/devel/scheller-linux-archive/bashEnvConf
    $ ./installHome
    Warning: Failed making backup of old ~/.vim/vimrc

  I'll need to configure Vundle for vim, following the instructions I put into
  my ~/vim/vimrc config file:

    $ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    $ vim
    :PluginInstall

  Login message suggested the important security updates
  needed installing.  Found out that my geoff user was "not
  in the sudoers file."  I used the visudo command which edits
  /etc/sudoers config file to allow anyone in the wheel
  group to use sudo.  Uncommented the appropriate line.

    $ sudo yum update

  This updated 10 packages, including a kernel update.  No systemctl
  command to reboot system.

    $ sudo shutdown -r now

  System rebooted quickly.
