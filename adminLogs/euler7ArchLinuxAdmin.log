Purpose: To rebuild from scratch maxwell4 after
         it crashed.  Named after Leonard Euler's
         solution to the KÃ¶nigsberg Bridge Problem.

  Got valid and the correct files.  Due diligence done!

  Put a previous thumbdrive in, last month's arch iso got "automounted"
  so un-mount it

    $ sudo umount /run/media/grs/ARCH_202111

  Image thumbdrive.

    $ sudo dd bs=4M if=archlinux-2021.12.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdd

    -rw-r--r-- 1 grs grs 891629568 Dec  4 15:25 archlinux-2021.12.01-x86_64.iso

  Remove and reinsert thumbdrive.

    $ df -h

  Boot what is left of maxwell4 from the thumbdrive.
  Hit <F12> on this to Dell "One-Time Boot Setting" and
  boot from "UEFI TOSHIBA" (with USB icon):

  Now at the archiso root prompt.

2021-12-04:
  The lsblk command is still showing all the nvme
  drives I created for maxwell4.  I ran fsck against

    /dev/nvme0n1p3 (/ for maxwell4)
    /dev/nvme1n1p1 (/home for maxwell4)
    /dev/nvme0n1p1 (/boot for maxwell4)

  For the last one it said only minor difference
  between primary & backup block (I forget exact
  terminology) and offered to swap in backup for
  primary.  I did so and wrote changes.

  Still broken when I tried to reboot.

2021-12-04:
  Back at the archiso root prompt.

    # iwctl device list

  One wireless device, wlan0 in station mode.

    # iwctl station wlan0 scan
    # iwctl station wlan0 get-networks
    # iwctl --passphrase <pass phrase> station wlan0 connect <SSID>

  Able to ping 1.1.1.1 and archlinux.org.  The getent command unable
  to resolve DNS for IPv4.  Don't worry about this for now.

  Next step, sync with time servers

    # timedatectl set-ntp true

  Look at what is already there

    # lsblk
    Name         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    loop0          7:0    0 701.3M  1 loop /run/archiso/airootfs

      nvme0n1p1  259:5    0  27.2G  0 part

  Good, no RAID things are there.  I'll keep the partitions,
  but will redo the file systems.

  Intended disk layout:
  
    /dev/nvme0n1p1    /boot  (fat32)
    /dev/nvme0n1p2    swap
    /dev/nvme0n1p3    /      (ext4)
    /dev/nvme1n1p1    /home  (ext4)

  Do I try and fix what I got or reinstall from scratch?
  Reinstall...

    # mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
    # mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p3
    # mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1p1

    # mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt
    # mkdir /mnt/home
    # mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/home
    # mkdir /mnt/boot
    # mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot
    # mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p2
    # swapon /dev/nvme0n1p2

  Note: When I did the mkswap, I Got

    warning: wiping old swsuspend signature.

  I had just configured maxwell4 to suspend/hibernate
  and had confirmed I could trigger such.  Maybe things
  didn't work out when system tried on its own?  I had
  left the system unattended for a while.  I had it
  unplugged for a while, but I think it went south a
  while after plugging it back in.

  This time I won't set up suspend/hibernate features.

  Went to use reflector, but found that the reflector
  service was run and configured /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.
  The reflector service and timer are currently inactive.
  The service is enabled (runs on boot) but the timer
  is disabled.  (That is for the OS running on the ISO).
  
  Install essential packages to target system,

    # pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware

  Note (From Arch wiki install guide):
    - linux can be substituted for another kernel package
    - linux omitted entirely if installed into a container
    - linux-firmware can be omitted if installed into either
      a container or virtual machine

  Configure /etc/fstab

    # genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
 
  Chroot into the target system.

    # arch-chroot /mnt

  Configure time zone.

    # ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Denver /etc/localtime
    # hwclock --systohc

  No editor, install nvim.

    # pacman -Syu neovim

  Localization, uncommented en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 in
  /etc/locale.gen

    # locale-gen

  Create /etc/locale.conf with contents

    LANG=en_US.UTF-8

  Give target system a hostname, create /etc/hostname
  with contents

    euler7

  Need to install some networking related packages,

    # pacman -Syu iwd systemd-resolvconf modemmanager
    # ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolve.conf /etc/resolve.conf
    ln: '/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolve.conf' and '/etc/resolv.conf' are the same file
    
  Opps, something has changed from last month.

    # ls -i /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
    2617 /etc/resolve.conf  2617 /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

  Hard linked!

    # systemctl is-enabled systemd-resolved
    disabled
    # systemctl enable systemd-resolved

  I will use the systemd boot loader

    # bootctl install
    Created "/boot/EFI"
    Created "/boot/EFI/systemd"
    Created "/boot/EFI/BOOT"
    Created "/boot/loader"
    Created "/boot/loader/entries"
    Created "/boot/EFI/Linux"
    Copied "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi" \
              to "/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi".
    Copied "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi" \
              to "/boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI".
    Created "/boot/987dc5a567e54739920b683cb519cf9f".
    Random seed file /boot/loader/random-seed successfully written (512 bytes).
    Created EFI boot entry "Linux Boot Manager".

  Lets see if what we currently have even boots.  It created
  a loader.conf and no entries/*.conf.  My guess it will give
  me a boot menu with no choices except for the firmware.

    # ^D
    # systemctl poweroff

  It did exactly what I predicted!  Instead of just parroting
  what I did for gauss17 and the limited example given
  in Systemd-boot ArchWiki, I will read through the 
  loader.conf(5) man page first.
