Purpose: To indicate what was done to create euler7 and
         the rational behind it.

2020-06-06:
  To satisfy my minimalistic Unix tastes, I think I will
  bring up another system probably with one of the BSD's.
  I am leaning towards OpenBSD, but haven't ruled out
  FreeBSD.

  Tentative name: euler7.
