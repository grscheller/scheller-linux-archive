Purpose: To indicate what was done to create euler7 and
         the rational behind it.

  To satisfy my minimalistic Unix tastes, I think I will
  bring up another system probably with one of the BSD's.
  I am leaning towards OpenBSD, but haven't ruled out
  FreeBSD.

  Tentative name: euler7.

  The native root shell on FreeBSD is tcsh and for regular 
  users is their version of the Bourne shell.  Bash is
  available as a package or in the ports collection, but
  is not considered native.  I don't like these choices.

  At this point ZFS would be the only reason to choose
  FreeBSD over OpenBSD.  Since I can't afford the hardware
  to fully take advantage of ZFS without being hit by a
  massive performance penalty, I will be targetting OpenBSD
  for euler7.

  For OpenBSD, the default shell for both root and users
  is ksh.  This shell is an old friend, and close enough
  to bash so I should have no need to install bash.  My
  bash has a strong ksh dialect anyway.

  Probably will use XFCE as the GUI.
