Creating a bootable USB thumb drive.

Downloading the ISO and signature files from one random US Arch download
mirror.

I have done my due diligence!

this. Plugged in into euler7.

Hummm...

Looks like I will need to boot off of sda2. Rebooting with the thumb
drive in did not work. Getting late, I will go home and try on gauss17.

## 2024-11-24:

Well, I broke my Arch Linux install on gauss17.

Have not been able to configure systemd-boot for for my Arch reinstall
on gauss17. Both with `fdsk` and `parted` I am not able to get UEFI
firmware to recognize the drive the bootloader is installed on as an EFI
drive.

I don't remember ever going through this before. The thumbdrive was
configured with Grub.

* maybe Pacman "magic" was done in the past to properly update partition
* my UEFI firmware is now almost 8 years old on gauss17

Next step would be to use Grub.

Instead decided to go with PoP!OS 24.04 Alpha III release

* was waiting for the actual release
* downloaded both
  * Intel/AMD ISO (to install on gauss17 -> noether2)
  * NVIDIA ISO (godel2)

Verified checksums.

## 2024-12-02

Booted into UEFI BIOS. Only change made was to reset OS from Windows to
Other.

Booted off of the Pop!OS NVIDIA ISO.

Using gparted:

* nvme0n1p1   /boot/efi   2.1G      %       EFI
* nvme0n1p2   swap       68.7G      %       swap
* nvme0n1p3   /var      274.9G      %       Var(/var)
* nvme0n1p4   /           359G      %       Root(/)
* nvme1n1p1   /home        27G      50%     Home(/home)
* nvme1n1p1   /extra       27G      50%     Extra(/extra)

Completed GUI install, created user grs. Left thumbdrive in from
experience with hamilton4.

Got the message

```
    You are inemergency mode. After logging in type "journalctl -xb" to view
    the system logs, "systemctl reboot" to reboot, or "exit" to continue
    bootup. Press Enter for maintenance (or press Control-D to continue):
```

I pressed Enter. Live Ethernet cable is plugged in.

```bash
    journalctl -xb | grep -i Failed
```

Something about home.mount stood out to me.

```
home.mount: Job home.mount/start failed with result 'dependency'.
...
    pop-os pop-system-updater[1072]: W: Some index files failed to
    download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
```

Something about data.mount too.

The `ip addr` command shows no IP4 or IP6 addresses. Not unexpected for
something like the old "single user mode."

```bash
    df -h
    Filesystem       Size  Used  Avail  Use%  Mounted on
    tmpfs            9.2G  1.9M   9.2G    1%  /run

    /dev/nnvme0n1p1  2.0G   92M   2.0G   5%   /boot/efi
```

No zram0, /home and /extra.

Using `lsblk` I see that the first drive got mounted OK.

Lets look at /etc/fstab with vi.

```
    # <file system>       <mount pt> <type>   ...    <dump> <pass>
    PARTUUID=e48...a47a71 /boot/efi   vfat    ...      0      0
    /dev/mapper/cryptswap      none   swap    ...      0      0
    UUID=7e0465...b3ee8c6      /var   ext4    ...      0      0
    UUID=d90ff5...6ab340f         /   ext4    ...      0      1
    UUID=6709f0...d2a6d4a     /home   ext4    ...      0      0
    UUID=9607ea...727f136     /data   ext4    ...      0      0
```
Using `lsblk- f` I see that

```
    nvme0n1p1  3A1B-82AC                             <vfat>
    nvme0n1p2  f60db79c-cd08-4a65-97b3-55806a9b1e8e  swap
    nvme0n1p3  7e046598-a15e-4b7a-a2f7-ce76b63ee8c6  /var

    nvme1n1p1  4457b2b4-de6c-4a81-ab5c-3e0ff871dd68  /home
    nvme1n1p2  152ae2cf-58ff-4b5e-b393-7f6a25dffbb8  /data
```

where I changed /extra to /data. I made doubly sure I got the last two
UUID's correct. Based on this info, and how hamilton4's /etc/fstab is
layed out, I will update /etc/fstab. Not sure where the installer got
the UUID's for the /home and /data mounts.

```
    PARTUUID=e488a8a6-589b-4248-ab41-513dd8a47a71 /boot/efi vfat ... 0 0
    /dev/mapper/cryptswap                         none      swap ... 0 0
    UUID=7e046598-a15e-4b7a-a2f7-ce76b63ee8c6     /var      ext4 ... 0 2
    UUID=d90ff567-555d-41c0-b39a-da2496ab340f     /         ext4 ... 0 1
    UUID=4457b2b4-de6c-4a81-ab5c-3e0ff871dd68     /home     ext4 ... 0 3
    UUID=152ae2cf-58ff-4b5e-b393-7f6a25dffbb8     /data     ext4 ... 0 2
```

  I verified the home and data mount points were there. I will still
  leave the thumbdrive in and reboot.

  I am not sure what I did, but as I fumbled with `reboot` and
  `poweroff` the system offered me to continue the boot process. I said
  yes and it put me at the2024-12-02 display manager. I logged in and /home/grs
  was setup.

```bash
    df -h
    Filesystem       Size  Used  Avail  Use%  Mounted on
    tmpfs            9.2G  2.1M   9.2G    1%  /run
    efivars          128K   68K    56K   56%  /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
    /dev/nnvme0n1p4  621G  7.2G   583G    2%  /
    tmpfs             46G     0    46G   0%   /dev/shm
    tmpfs            5.0M     0   5.0M   0%   /dev/lock
    /dev/nnvme0n1p1  2.0G   92M   2.0G   5%   /boot/efi
    /dev/nnvme0n1p3  251G  625M   238G   1%   /var
    /dev/nnvme1n1p2  938G   28K   891G   1%   /data
    /dev/nnvme1n1p1  938G   28K   891G   1%   /home
    tmpfs            9.2G  116K   9.2M   0%   /run/usr/1000
```

Except for the sizes of things and the extra /data directory, the output
of the above command looks very similar to hamilton4.

## 2024-12-02:

I am getting the same nvidia-powerd.service failure as I did before on
hamilton4. Also the 2 Ethernet ports cards and the wireless are not
working. I suspect I need drivers for these?

Before going too deep down into the rabbit-hole, will do some
general maintenance.

System is in the Etc/UTC timezone. Need to fix this.

```bash
    $ sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Denver
```

Update the system.

```bash
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt upgrade
    $ sudo apt install neofetch
```

Gave root a password, then edited `/etc/hostname` and changed the
host name to godel2.

Now install ssh.service, along with suggested optional dependencies.

```bash
    $ sudo apt install openssh-server molly-guard livmsv1 ssh-askpass
    $ sudo systemctl enable ssh.service
    $ sudo systemctl start ssh.service
    $ systemctl status ssh.service
    $ systemctl status ssh.service

```

Tomorrow I will figure out what molly-guard and Monkeysphere are. I was
able to ssh into godel2 from hamilton4. Successfully pasted above
output.

## 2024-12-03:

Set up password-less ssh between godel2 and hamilton4.

### TODO:

Since in the future I may be sharing the system admin role on godel2,
I will need to redo ssh certs with passphases and configure the
infrastructure to make entering the pin as painless as possible.

Will also need to move the ssh service to a high port.

## 2024-12-03:

Time to install some Nerd fonts. Downloaded `firacode` and `robotomono`
nerd fonts from the [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) website.

As root,

```bash
    mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/{firacode,robotomono}
    cd /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/firacode
    unzip ~grs/catch/FireCode.zip
    cd ../robotomono
    unzip ~grs/catch/RobotoMono.zip/
```

Now install a version of Neovim that will work with my nvim
configuration.

```bash
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
    $ sudo apt install neovim wl-clipboard
    $ nvim --version
    Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
    NVIM v0.11.0-dev
    Build type: RelWithDebInfo
    LuaJIT 2.1.1703358377
```

After configuring my ssh authentication and with GitHub, I cloned my
dotfiles repo and from there installed my dotfiles to my home directory
on godel2.

Now install fish.

```bash
    $ sudo apt install fish wl-clipboard
    $ sudo apt install doc-base
```

What I did more or less got nvim to configure itself. Might as well
finish the process.

```fish
    $ sudo apt install fswatch nodejs npm
    $ sudo npm install -g neovim
    $ sudo npm install -g tree-sitter-cli
```

This gave me all the tools I need to finish configuring Neovim for my
local user grs. Used lazy plugin manager and mason package manager.

## 2024-12-03:

Installed some additional utilities.

```fish
    $ sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep
    $ sudo apt install alacritty
    $ sudo apt install nomacs
    $ sudo apt install htop
```

Nomacs is just an image viewer I like.

Alacritty is a terminal emulator. Cosmic-term is actually an alacritty
fork. Due to alacritty using an actual config file, I have a lot more
control over its configuration than what System76 exposes to me in the
settings app.

For some reason `fd` gets installed under the `fdfind` name. Too much
typing for its use case in command line scripting. Some old terminal
file manager dating back to MS-DOS days called `fdclone` has dibs on the
`fd` name in the Ubuntu repo world. Unlikely it will ever be installed.

As root,

```bash
    cd /usr/bin
    ls -l fd*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 19 Dec 30  2023 fdfind -> ../lib/cargo/bin/fd
    ln -s fdfind fd
    ls -l fd*
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  6 Dec  3 13:03 fd -> fdfind
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 19 Dec 30  2023 fdfind -> ../lib/cargo/bin/fd
```

## 2024-12-03:

Preparing the system for Python development.

First step is to add the libraries needed to build Python executables
from source.

```fish
    $ sudo apt update; sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev \
    zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl git \
    libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev \
    libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

For the latest build dependency information, see
[pyenv wiki - build environment](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment).
Since Ubuntu is Pop!OS's upstream, I used the recommendations for
Ubuntu/Debian/Mint.

Surprisingly, pyenv is not part of the Pop!OS (or Ubuntu) repos.
Probably best if individual users install it locally in their individual
home directories. After doing my due diligence verifying the install
scripts will not do anything malicious, I installed pyenv into my grs
home directory.

```fish
    $ curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

You will need to update your shell startup scripts for this change to
take effect. For the bash shell, put this at the end of your `.bashrc`
file,

```
    PATH="$PATH:~/.local/share/pyenv/bin"
    if which -s pyenv
    then
       eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    fi
```

## 2024-12-05:

Neither 2.5GB nor 10GB on motherboard working consistently.
Occasionally the 2.5GB works for short time.

I noticed wifi was on. Turned it off with Network Manager and rebooted.

Lights came on shortly, then Ethernet port dead.

```fish
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt upgrade
   $ sudo apt dist-upgrade
   $ sudo apt autoremove
   $ sudo apt autoclean
   $ sudo fwupdmgr get-devices
   $ sudo fwupdmgr get-updates
   $ sudo fwupdmgr update
   $ flatpak update
   $ sudo reboot now
```

Reboot. Without USB Ethernet dongle. See if I can ping.

More thrashing. Decided to drop Network Manager.

Following https://linux.fernandocejas.com/docs/how-to/switch-from-network-manager-to-systemd-networkd

```fish
    $ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
    $ sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager
    $ sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd

    $ sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
    $ sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

    $ sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
    $ sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

    $ sudo reboot now
```
This is very familiar to me from setting up systemd-networkd on Arch
Linux.

After reading:

* adminLogs/godel2_PopOS_log.md
* Archwiki systemd.networkd
* Debian wiki

Created the /etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network file with the contents

```
    [Match]
    Name = "enp10s0"

    [Network]
    DHCP = true
```

The card did chat with the switch, but failed to establish a connection.

### Ethernet controller I226-V (enp10s0) now working!

As soon as I replaced the old CAT-5 cable with a newer CAT-6 cable, the
interface came alive.

The link of `/etc/resolv.conf` points to

```bash
    root@godel2:/etc# ls -l resolv.conf
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Dec  5 18:10 resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
```

This means systemd.resolved local DNS server is being bypassed.

Some clean up based on what I did for noether2.

Changes `/etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network` to

```
    [Match]
    Name=enp10s0

    [Network]
    DHCP=yes
```

Note that at this time I am not configuring `enp11s0` nor the WiFi which
is not even brought up.

Least I forget, lets at least install the `iwd` package.

```bash
    apt install iwd
```

Reboot.

```fish
    $ ping 1.1.1.1
    PING 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

At least it not running in some sort of "degraded" mode. Let's try
plumbing `systemd-resolved` back in.

```bash
    cd /etc/
    ls -l resolv.conf
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Dec  5 18:10 resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
    # ls -l resolv.conf
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Dec  5 18:10 resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
    root@godel2:/etc# rm resolv.conf
    root@godel2:/etc# ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf resolv.conf
    root@godel2:/etc# ls -l resolv.conf
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 39 Dec  7 11:48 resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
```

Now reboot.

Same as before.

## 2024-12-09:

## Add CCTI network printer

Added printer "bizhub_c300i" by where Gunner sits.

```fish
    $ sudo lpadmin -p bizhub_c300i -E -v ipp://10.55.30.24 -m "everywhere" -L "by Gunner"
```

Also, Catalyst Campus network admin Eric set godel2 IP address to be
static:

* 10.54.4.180/24

## 2024-12-09:

Noticed that to ssh between godel2 and hamilton4 I need to do

```fish
    $ ssh godel2.local
    $ ssh hamilton4.local
```

while from my windows box both below work.

```powershell
    > ssh grs@godel2
    > ssh grs@hamilton4
```

Note: Previously configured avahi-daemon.service on godel2 and hamilton4.

## 2025-02-07:

Need to install DoD Certs. First install drivers for CAC reader.

```fish
    $ sudo apt install libccid opensc pcsc-tools
```

## 2025-02-13:

### Ensure CAC Reader drivers working

As seen before, CAC Reader not responding when plugged into an already
booted system. Plug CAC reader into a USB-A 3.0 port on top of computer
and rebooted. There are 2 each USB-A 2.0 & 3.0 ports there.

CAC reader lighted up when CAC inserted.

```fish
    $ systemctl status pcscd.socket
    ● pcscd.socket - PC/SC Smart Card Daemon Activation Socket

    Feb 13 11:27:42 godel2 systemd[1]: Listening on pcscd.socket - PC/SC Smart Card Daemon Activation Socket.
```

### System-wide configure DoD PKI

Will repeat some of what was done on hamilton4 as if I performed all the
steps here. Actually took shortcuts.

Download DoD Certs from [download site](https://public.cyber.mil/dod-certs/).

Seems Windoze and Muc use executable installers.

From [military CAC](https://militarycac.com/linux.htm) webite, download
link is now: `https://militarycac.com/maccerts/AllCerts.zip`

Download and unzipped here: `~/build/dod-certs`

```fish
    $ ls
     AllCerts.zip            'DOD EMAIL CA-73.cer'   DoDRoot5.cer
    'DOD DERILITY CA-1.cer'  'DOD ID CA-59.cer'      DoDRoot6.cer
    'DOD DERILITY CA-3.cer'  'DOD ID CA-62.cer'     'DOD SW CA-60.cer'
    'DOD DERILITY CA-4.cer'  'DOD ID CA-63.cer'     'DOD SW CA-61.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-59.cer'    'DOD ID CA-64.cer'     'DOD SW CA-66.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-62.cer'    'DOD ID CA-65.cer'     'DOD SW CA-67.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-63.cer'    'DOD ID CA-70.cer'     'DOD SW CA-68.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-64.cer'    'DOD ID CA-71.cer'     'DOD SW CA-69.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-65.cer'    'DOD ID CA-72.cer'     'DOD SW CA-74.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-70.cer'    'DOD ID CA-73.cer'     'DOD SW CA-75.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-71.cer'     DoDRoot3.cer          'DOD SW CA-76.cer'
    'DOD EMAIL CA-72.cer'     DoDRoot4.cer          'DOD SW CA-77.cer'
```

From militarycac website, the certs that need installing are

* DOD DERILITY CA-1
* DOD EMAIL CA-59,
* DOD EMAIL CA-62 through DOD EMAIL CA-65,
* DOD EMAIL 70 through 73,
* DOD ID CA-59,
* DOD ID CA-62 through DOD ID CA-65,
* DOD ID CA-70 through 73,
* DoD Root CA 3 through DoD Root CA 6,
* DOD SW CA-60 through DOD SW CA-61,
* DOD SW CA-66 through DOD SW CA-69, and
* DOD SW CA-74 through 77

Divided certs between directories `used/` and `unused/`.

Files ending in `.cer` are in the DER binary format. They need to be
converted to `.crt` files in the PEM format.

```fish
    $ cd used/
    $ for fl in *.cer
          openssl x509 -inform der -outform pem -in $fl -out (echo $fl|sed 's/cer/crt/')
      end
    Could not read certificate from DoDRoot6.cer
    Unable to load certificate
```

It seemed that DoDRoot6.cer was already in PEM format. Might have
happened when I was experimenting with the openssl command?

```fish
    $ mv DoDRoot6.cer DoDRoot6.crt
```

Now copy PEM certs up to their "canonical" location and update certs.

```fish
    $ sudo cp *.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
    $ sudo update-ca-certificates
    Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...

Figured out it is enough to logout and back on to get CAC reader
working. Full reboot not needed. Suspect best practice is to inssert CAC
before logging on.

* Firefox worked perfectly with CAC enabled sites
  * Firefox was NOT individually configured
* Brave tries to connect but connections fail
  * Brave cannot be individually configured
  * maybe Brave installed as a FlatPak has something to do with it

After an apt upgrade, Nvidia drivers broke. Had to uninstall and
reinstall drivers to fix.

```fish
    $ sudo apt purge ~nnvidia
    $ sudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia
```

Over the weekend I was not able to access godel2. When I got to work
Monday morning the system was booted but no network access. Reboot and
network worked. After about an hour network non-functional again.

From `journalctl -b`: "igc crashes with igc failed to read reg 0xc030"

This caused be to do
a DuckDuckGo search 'pop os igc failed to read reg' where I got this
[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xypn1m/network_card_intel_ethernet_controller_i225v_igc/?rdt=54143).

Seems that this is a recurring problem with Intel Ethernet Controllers
with NVIDIA GPU drivers after about an hour of inactivity. I rebooted
and did an

```fish
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

The NVIDIA drivers were update. But an hour later, godel2's network
connection was down again. I did another `jounelctl -b` and got

The Reddit post and other such posts indicated it is an ASUS problem
that hasn't yet been fixed but there is a workaround. Need to throttle
down power management by adding adding 2 boot options:

* `pcie_port_pm=off`
* `pcie_aspm.policy=performance`

Found several examples on had to fix on Debian SID and Arch for the GRUB
bootloader. After careful reverse engineering and manual reading,
I figured out how to do it on Pop!OS with SystemD Boot.

As root,

```bash
    kernelstub -a 'pcie_port_pm=off'
    kernelstub -a 'pcie_aspm.policy=performance'
    reinstall-kernels
    reboot
```

Before I did this, I tested these out by tapping the `e` key during
reboot. This allowed me to edit the cmdline boot options. Later
I learned one can hold down space bar to catch boot menu and then press
the `e` key.

More factoids:

```fish
    $ cat /proc/cmdline
    initrd=\EFI\Pop_OS-d90ff567-555d-41c0-b39a-da2496ab340f\initrd.img root=UUID=d90ff567-555d-41c0-b39a-da2496ab340f ro quiet loglevel=0 systemd.show_status=false splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1 pcie_port_pm=off pcie_aspm.policy=performance

I had just upgrade the firmware on hamilton4. When I logged into the
Cosmic desktop environment I had a desktop notification of the same
firmware upgrade. I did a reboot because the network card was down
again. After reboot, I got the same notification again and clicked it.
I repeated what I did on hamilton4 but now though a series of GUI menus.

See same day how I did this using the cmdline on hamilton4.

## 2025-03-07:

That one that one time on 2025-04-04, I configured my Cosmic Desktop NOT
to put the monitor asleep after 20 minutes. Network card has not put
itself to sleep since them.

Cosmic-Terminal showing available Nerd Fonts.

While in "cooked mode" right-click -> Settings -> Advanced Font settings

Choice of 8 fonts,

* DejaVu Sans Mono
* Fira Mono
* FiraCode Nerd Font Mono
* Liberation Mono
* Nimbus Mono PS
* Noto Sans Mono
* RobotoMono Nerd Font
* RobotoMono Nerd Font Mono

Thinking about it, I think I am the one who installed the Nerd fonts.

Installed Rust toolchain on godel2. More to test my Neovim LSP
configuration.

```fish
    $ curl -f https://sh.rustup.rs > rust.sh
    $ chmod u+x rust.sh
    $ ./rust.sh
```

This installed `~/.config/fish/conf.d/rustup.fish` which just sources
`~/.cargo/env.fish` which just plops `~/.cargo/bin` in your path.

```fish
    $ rm ~/.config/fish/conf.d/rustup.fish
```

Then added to my fish configuration files

```fish
    # Rust toolchain
    test -e ~/.cargo/env.fish
    and set -p PATH ~/.cargo/bin
```

I like the rust toolchain:

```fish
    $ ls -l .cargo/bin/

```

Launching Neovim on rust source code, I get an error in the LSP log file
`/home/grs/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log`.

```
[START][2025-03-12 14:25:57] LSP logging initiated
[ERROR][2025-03-12 14:25:57] ...p/_transport.lua:36	"rpc"	"/home/grs/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer"	"stderr"	"error: Unknown binary 'rust-analyzer' in official toolchain 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'.\n"
```

As I recall, I am having Mason install rust-analyzer. Put rust-analyzer
in the exclude table of the automatic_installation table. Used Mason GUI
to uninstall rust-analyzer from `~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/`.

```fish
    $ ls ~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/
    bash-language-server  taplo                       vscode-html-language-server
    lua-language-server   vscode-css-language-server  zls
```

Same error message in the LSP log file.

I am using saecki/crates.nvim for my rust LSP configuration. Going to
its Github repo I find it has been archived with the message:

```
    Due to lack of time, this plugin has been archived.
    Please switch to mrcjkb/rustaceanvim.
```

Oh yeah, at one time I knew this.

2025-03-12:

Let's get `mrcjkb/rustaceanvim` configured and working.

#### Prerequisites

Required:

* rust-analyzer - provided by rustup

Optional:

* dot from graphviz - installed graphviz via apt
* cargo - installed by rustup
* lldb or codelldb - something called rust-lldb installed by rustup
* treesitter rust parser - installed by neovim configs

#### Minimal installation and configurations

```lua
    {
       'mrcjkb/rustaceanvim',
       version = '^5', -- Recommended
       lazy = false, -- This plugin is already lazy
    }
```

#### Initial setup:

Quick setup guide is suggesting that keymaps get set up in
`~/.config/nvim/after/ftplugin/rust.lua`. Not sure yet how I will
trigger the 2 special keymaps and the rest of the LSP keymaps. For
a first go around, I will just install the plugin and try a few things
from cmd-mode. The `mrcjkb/rustaceanvim` Github page does not mention
the `saecki/crates.nvim` plugin at all.

#### Results

Still getting same error in ``.

```

[START][2025-03-12 16:56:23] LSP logging initiated
[ERROR][2025-03-12 16:56:23] ...p/_transport.lua:36	"rpc"	"/home/grs/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer"	"stderr"	"error: Unknown binary 'rust-analyzer' in official toolchain 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'.\n"
```

Next step is to look up what the error means.

## 2025-03-13:

After some searching, turns out the rust-analyzer is not installed, just
the "stub" for it.

```
    $ rustup component add rust-analyzer
```

After this, the LSP worked.

## 2025-03-13:

Used rustup to add missing rust toolchain components.

```
    $ rustup component add cargo clippy llvm-tools rls \
             rust-analysis rust-analyzer rust-docs rust-src \
             rust-std rustc
    info: component 'cargo' for target 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' is up to date

    info: component 'rustc' for target 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' is up to date
```

Then installed lldb which rust-lldb needs.

```
    $ sudo apt install lldb
    $ lldb --version
    lldb version 18.1.3
    $ rust-lldb
    lldb version 18.1.3
```

## 2025-03-24:

Seems that "sudo apt full-upgrade" and "sudo apt dist-update" do
"essentually" the same thing. While researching these, I came across
the pop-upgrade command.

With more gusto than intelligence, lets run it

```bash
    $ pop-upgrade release upgrade -f
    checking if pop-upgrade requires an update
    Current Release: 24.04
    Upgrading to: 26.04
    New version available: false

    Caused by:
        0: failed to update source lists
        1: status is unknown: exit status: 100
```

Seems to have broken Neovim too.

```
    $ nvim --version
    NVIM v0.9.5
    Build type: Release
    LuaJIT 2.1.1703358377

       system vimrc file: "$VIM/sysinit.vim"
      fall-back for $VIM: "/usr/share/nvim"

    Run :checkhealth for more info
```

Neovim  got down graded!

Before researching `pop-upgrade`, let us fix Neovim.

```bash
    $ sudo apt remove neovim
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt full-upgrade       # some complaining
    $ sudo apt install neovim
    $ nvim --version
    NVIM v0.11.0-dev
    Build type: RelWithDebInfo
    LuaJIT 2.1.1703358377
    Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
```

Aside: Noticed that out-of-the-box Neovim was indenting a paste.

Regarding `pop-upgrade` see `https://github.com/pop-os/upgrade/pull/330`
where there was a problem when Ansible was installed from a PPA
`https://github.com/pop-os/upgrade/issues/340`.

## 2025-04-23:

Current fish version bit prehistoric, version 3.7.1. 

```
   $ sudo apt autoremove
   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-4
   $ sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Then rebooted.
