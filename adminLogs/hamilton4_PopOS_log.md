## Purpose

To rebuild my euler7 Arch Linux laptop using Pop!OS. Arch Linux has
served me well and I have learned much, but right now Pop!OS serves
better serving my needs on the hardware I have access to and my time
restraints.

Named after mathematician William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of the
Quaternions. The Quanterions form a four-dimensional associative normed
division algebra over the real numbers, and therefore a ring, also
a division ring and a domain. It was the first noncommutative division
algebra to be discovered.
