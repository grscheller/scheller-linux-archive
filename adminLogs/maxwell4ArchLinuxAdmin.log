  Installed Arch Linux on a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1.
    - 4 core i7-10510U CPU 1.8 GHz
    - 16 GB memory
    - Realtek Audio
    - UEFI system
    - NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics
    
  The Nvidia chipset is several years old.  It designed as
  standalone but can function in a Optimus mode.  It does
  not support Wayland, so I am stuck with XOrg.

  System is for work.  Currently has Window 10 installed.
  Was able to get into the UEFI firmware via pressing F12
  at boot (without the fn key).

  Turned off secureboot.  Also turned off some features
  which helped improve vurtual machine usage.  Could
  not figure out how to change the boot order to boot
  from USB memory stick by default, but with bootable
  USB memory stick in place, could boot to it via the
  UEFI firmware.
