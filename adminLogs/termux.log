Purpose: To track what I did to configure to configure Termux
         on my Andriod Cell Phome:

  I had Termux installed for a while.  I have no
  desire to "root" the phone.  Androids cordons off
  Termux on the internal memmory, I can't share files
  between Termux and the other Apps.  I want to point
  the Firefox browser app at my file based homepage I
  clone from GitHub.

  I installed DropBox, but I have the same problem.
  DropBox won't share files with the other Apps.

  I got a 32G SD card for the phone.  Lets see if
  I can get Firefox and Termux to both used the same
  memory on the card.

  I have an LG Phoenix 4 Android cell phone which
  I have previously installed Termux on it.

  Today I installed a 32GB SD card.  To get Termux to be
  able to access it, I proformed the following from the
  command line:

    $ termux-setup-storage

  It created a bunch of symlinks here -> ~/storage
