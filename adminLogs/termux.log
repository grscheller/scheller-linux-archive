Purpose: To track what I did to configure to configure Termux
         on my Andriod Cell Phome:

  I had Termux installed for a while.  I have no
  desire to "root" the phone.  Androids cordons off
  Termux on the internal memmory, I can't share files
  between Termux and the other Apps.  I want to point
  the Firefox browser app at my file based homepage I
  clone from GitHub.

  I installed DropBox, but I have the same problem.
  DropBox won't share files with the other Apps.

  I got a 32G SD card for the phone.  Lets see if
  I can get Firefox and Termux to both used the same
  memory on the card.

  I have an LG Phoenix 4 Android cell phone which
  I have previously installed Termux on it.

  What Abdroid says the phone is:

    Settings ->
       System ->
          About phone ->
             Software info ->
                Android version:  8.1.0
                Kernel version:   3.18.71
                Software Version: X210AMPM20t
             Hardware info ->
                LM-X210APM

  What Termx thinks the phone is:

    $ uname -a
    Linux localhost 3.18.71-perf+ #1 SMP PREEMPT
    Fri Aug 14 16:22:30 KST 2020 armv71 Android

  Today I installed a 32GB SD card.  To get Termux to be
  able to access it, I proformed the following from the
  command line:

    $ termux-setup-storage

  It put links here -> ~/storage

    dcim -> /storage/emulated/0/DCIM
    downloads -> /storage/emulated/0/Download
    external-1 -> /storage/10A9-B539/Android/data /com.termux/files
    movies -> /storage/emulated/0/Movies
    music -> /storage/emulated/0/Music
    pictures -> /storage/emulated/0/Pictures
    shared -> /storage/emulated/0

  These are hardlinks

    $ ls -id /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/ ~/storage/pictures/
    16397 /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/pictures/
    16397 /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/

  Some of the intervening directories my Termux user does not
  have full permissions for them.

    $ ls -ld /storage/emulated/
    drwx--x--x 4 root everybody 4096 Dec 31 2017 /storage/emulated/

  Happly, I was able to move my homepage.html and its style sheet
  to where Firefox 84,0,0-beta 2 could find them.

    file:///storage/emulated/0/Pictures/homepage.html

  Had to bookmark location, seems that this version of Firefox
  has no concept of a Home Page.  Pictures/ is a good location,
  will probably never put pictures there.
