## Abstract Data Types (ADT)
Exploring approaches to ADT in various computer languages.
I was inspired by these blog posts by Tony Morris,
[The Algebra of Algebraic Data Types](https://about.chatroulette.com/posts/algebraic-data-types/)
and
[More Algebra of Algebraic Data Types](https://about.chatroulette.com/posts/algebraic-data-types-2/).

### Java
To compile, run and cleanup
```
   $ cd Java/
   $ javac ADT.java
   $ java ADT
   $ rm *.class
```

### Scala
To compile, run and cleanup
```
   $ cd Scala/
   $ scalac ADT.scala
   $ scala comp.adt.ADT
   $ rm -r comp/
```
