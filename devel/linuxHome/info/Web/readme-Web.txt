This is an "old school" homepage but done in a 
"new school" way.  Goal is to make a personal home
page for my bookmarks and password schemas in a
simple and clear cut way.  I try and keep content
(html) and style (css) as separate as possile.  
HTML can be a snake pit of complexity, I endeavor
to try to keep things as simple as possible.

I use a variety of different browsers and don't 
want to have to "sync" my book marks and passwords
schemas between them on the various systems I use.
I push these files to my various Linux and Windows
systems and then just set my home page in my browser
to ~/info/Web/homepage.

I don't want to share boookmarks or passwords in any
sort of "cloud" that I don't have control over.
Although a private GitHub page with ascii encrypted
files would work well for this.  I don't trust
"free as in beer" bookmark and password syncing
technologies.  If you don't pay for it, you are
not the customer and probably someone is data mining
you at best, or at worst, not doing their due diligents
protecting your passwords.  Same reason I use a
paid e-mail service.

Anyway, sometime early in 1994, when I first
started using web browsers, the web was organized
via directory sites.  Your "homepage" was just
your private starting point into these.  When search
engines emerged, everyone started using one as
their "homepage."  "Homepages" became personal
websites on school and ISP webservers.  Social
media more or less did these in.  Modern search engines
rank these personal homepages so low, they might as
well not exist.  Beware the filter bubble.
