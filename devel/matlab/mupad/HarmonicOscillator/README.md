The file, HarmonicOscWaveFunctions.mn, is a MATLAB MuPad
notebook which models a 1-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator
wave function.  I was curious on how the the function
looked for high wave number.

I haven't had MuPad on my MATLAB license for at least 5
years, so I can not vouch how well it will work for
later versions of MuPad.
