# Harmonic Oscillator Wave Function:
Mupad notebook to model a One-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator Wavefuntion.

## HarmonicOscWaveFunctions.mn
* Models a 1-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator wave function.
* I was curious about what it would look for high wave number.
* Uses MATLAB and the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox.

### Disclaimer:
I haven't had the MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox on my MATLAB license since about 2013.
I cannot vouch how well it will work for later versions of MuPad.
