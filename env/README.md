## Personnal UNIX/POSIX Shell Configuration
This project contains the infrastructure I use to
maintain and install my personnal UNIX based shell environment
on the computers I use.

"Forked" this from my
[Shell-environment-config](https://github.com/grscheller/shell-environment-config)
repo.  As I simplify that repo and make it a generic
starting point template.  I will customize this
sub-project to manage my personal bash, ksh, sh, dash
environments.
