# Functional Programming in Scala Book Exercises

## Functional data structures

Chapter 3.

Implementing List and rose Tree data structures while working
through the exercises in  "Functional Programming in Scala"
by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.

### fpinscala.datastructures.List
   * A strict Lisp-like Cons/Nil datastructure.

### fpinscala.datastructures.Tree
   * A strict Rose tree datastructure.

Using Scala traits, companion objects, and case classes to
implement datastructures.  Introducing a Scala feature called
Abstract Data Structures (ADT) and the distinction between
type and data constructors.

In the chapter, the functions are defined as methods of the
companion object.  Basically the List and Tree companion
objects are used as namespaces.
