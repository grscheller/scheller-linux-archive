# Functional Programming in Scala Book Exercises

## Functional data structures

Chapter 3.

Implementing List and Rose Tree data structures while working<br>
through the exercises in "Functional Programming in Scala"<br>
by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.

### [fpinscala.datastructures.List](List.scala)
* A strict Lisp-like Cons/Nil datastructure.

### [fpinscala.datastructures.Tree](Tree.scala)
* A strict tree datastructure where data is stored in the leaves.

Using Scala traits, companion objects, and case classes to implement<br>
datastructures.  Introducing a Scala feature called Abstract Data<br>
Structures (ADT) and the distinction between type and data constructors.

In the chapter, the functions are defined as methods of the<br>
companion object.  Basically the List and Tree companion objects<br>
are used as namespaces.
