Implementing a random number generation package using the
state.State Monad while working through the
exercises in  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul
Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.

From chapter 6.

At this point in the book, I am not supposed to know the 
term "monad" yet.  The code the book has gently led me
to write something very similar to the scalaz monad transformer.
