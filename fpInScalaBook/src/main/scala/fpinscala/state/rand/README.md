##Functional random number generator.

Implementing random number generation package rand
using the fpinscala.state.State Monad.  Basically,
reimplementating what was done in fpinscala.rngStandalone.

From chapter 6.

Note also the use of a package object defined in
package.scala to define the rand type alias at
the rand package level.
