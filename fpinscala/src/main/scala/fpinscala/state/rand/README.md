# Functional Programming in Scala Book Exercises

## Functional random number generator.

Implementing random number generation package rand
using the fpinscala.state.State Monad.  Basically,
reimplementating what was done in fpinscala.rngStandalone.

From chapter 6.

### [RNG and LCG classes](RNG.scala)
* Define abstract class RNG and the LCG implementation.

### [fpinscala.state.rand package object](package.scala)
* Used to define the rand type alias at the rand package level.

### Program [randTest](randTest.scala)
* Program to exercise package fpinscala.rand.
