# Abstract Data Types (ADT) - with Java

Exploring approaches to ADT in various computer languages.
I was inspired by these blog posts by Tony Morris,
[The Algebra of Algebraic Data Types](https://about.chatroulette.com/posts/algebraic-data-types/)
and
[More Algebra of Algebraic Data Types](https://about.chatroulette.com/posts/algebraic-data-types-2/).

## Java

To compile, run and cleanup

```
   $ javac ADT.java
   $ java ADT
   $ rm *.class
```
