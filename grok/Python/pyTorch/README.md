# Deep Learning with Python using PyTorch and Anaconda

To be consistent with what I am doing professionally, I am
using Anaconda instead of the Arch Linux Python.

* Initially Following the
  [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  website.
* Other useful information is on the
  [GitHub PyTourch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
  website.
* PyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks
* Like using and replaying a tape recorder
* See post 2018-02-14 entries in
  [gauss17 admin logs](../../../adminLogs/gauss17ArchLinuxAdmin.log)
  for the Anaconda setup.
