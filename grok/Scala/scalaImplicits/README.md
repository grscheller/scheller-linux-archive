# Keywords given and extension in Scala 3

The keywords `given` and `extension` replace the overloaded
keyword `implicit` from Scala 2.  The implicit keyword still
works as it did in Scala 2, but is deprecated and at some
point will be removed.

This project, scalaImplicits, impletements a
[Main.scala](src/main/scala/Main.scala) executable which is a
rewrite of the Scala 2 program
[implicits.scala](../../Scala2/learnScala/implicits/implicits.scala)
from grok/Scala2/learnScala project.

This project also implements simple junit tests.
