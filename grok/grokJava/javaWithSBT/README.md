# Building java code with SBT

## Purpose:
With Scala I find that SBT makes me much more productive than
typical IDE tools do.  I wish to see if this is true for Java too.

## Refeneces I am using:

* Building Java Projects With SBT:

* Translating a scala tutorial for java programmers back to java:
