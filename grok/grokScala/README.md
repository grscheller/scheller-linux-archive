## Scala:
Projects whose basic purpose is for me to learn a variety of
mostly functional JVM computer languages.

### [functional programming in scala](fpinscala/)
* Scala project where I work through the exercises in the book
  "Functional Programming in Scala" by Paul Chiusana and Runar Bjarnason.
* The book is more about learning Functional Programming than the
  Scala language per say.

### [functional programming for mortals](fpForMortals/)
* Scala project working through the book
  "Functional Programming for Mortals with Scalaz" by Sam Halliday.
* A collecton of standalone scalaz projects for purposes of learning scalaz.

### [learnScala](learnScala)
* Document factoids about the Scala language
* Illustrates a hierarchical SBT Scala build

### [grokJava](grok/grokJava/)
* An attempt to learn Java coming at it from a Python and Scala perspective
* Post Java 8 oriented
