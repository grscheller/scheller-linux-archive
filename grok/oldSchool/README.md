# Old School Programming
* Capture various "traditional" programming paradigms
* Create examples of various pre-1990 imperitive programming techniques
* Not necessarily resticted to pre-1990 languages or tools

## 1. [C Language Exempars](CExemplars/):
Short examples of best practices for ANSI-C coding.  A lot of factoids
in the comments.
* __hw.c__: Traditional Kerrigan & Richie Hello World C program.
* __removeSpaces.c__: O(n) string manipulation

## 2. [C Systems Programming](SystemsProgramming/):
I have always admired W. Richard Steven's books on Unix System
programming.  Back in the early 1990's, I thought someday I would
work my way through them.  Well, I have finally gotten around to
it, in 2018.  I want to investigate the use of bloody edge C++
as a general purpose language, but before I do so, I thought I'd
better learn what it is I am trying to replace.  Thanks to POSIX
standards, Steven's books are as relevant today as they were back
in the 1990's.

The books I am using are
"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment"
and
"UNIX Network Programming"
volumes 1 & 2.
* __myErrorHandlers.c__: Error handling routines.
* __myls__.c: Application to display file names in a directory.

## 3. [C++ to Infinity and Beyond](C++InfinityAndBeyond1/):
ANSI-C needs to be replaced.  Unfortunately, it is good enough never to be
replaced.  I feel C++, properly done as a GP programming language, could
be a safer and socially palitable replacement.  This project was inspired
by Bjarne Stroustrup's "A Tour of C++" Second Edition.
* __hw.cpp__: Buzz Lightyear's Hello World C++ program.

## 4. [Over Optimization](OverOptimization/):
C compilers can overly optimize code.

Example of the compiler doing the calculation and the program merely
printing a constant.

## 5. [XWindows](XWindows):
Examples of low level XWindows coding.
