# Old School Programming
* Capture various "traditional" programming paradigms
* Create examples of various pre-1990 imperitive programming techniques
* Not necessarily resticted to pre-1990 languages or tools
* Subtopic either answer simple questions or provide simple examples
* Provide simple templates as starting points for more involved
  projects. (It is always easier to edit than create from scratch.)

## 1. [Hello World](HelloWorld/):
Tradition demands we start with the canonical Hello World program.

Goal is to write short, but not an irrationally short, programs that
when run print the greeting "Hello, world!"

## 2. [Over Optimization](OverOptimization/):
C compilers can overly optimize code.

Example of the compiler doing the calculation and the program merely
printing a constant.
