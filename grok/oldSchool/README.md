# Old School Programming
* Capture various "traditional" programming paradigms
* Create examples of various pre-1990 imperitive programming techniques
* Not necessarily resticted to pre-1990 languages or tools

## 1. [C Language Exempars](CExeplars/):
Short examples of best practices for ANSI-C coding.  A lot of factoids
in the comments.
* __hw.c__: Traditional Kerrigan & Richie Hello World C program.
* __removeSpaces__: O(n) string manipulation

## 2. [Over Optimization](OverOptimization/):
C compilers can overly optimize code.

Example of the compiler doing the calculation and the program merely
printing a constant.

## 3. [XWindows](XWindows):
Examples of low level XWindows coding.
