Purpose: XFCE Desktop GUI environment configuration, 

XFCE-TERMINAL:
  Turned off menu and toolbar in new windows.

  Only in the menu bar, not toolbar, you can set/reset
  keyboard shorts via hovering over item and hit key 
  combo.  This is a new GTK feature.

  Note: I am ecstatic about this feature.  I find the
        toolbar find utility occationally useful, but
        don't like the real estate these GUI items
        take up.

  Set F12 to toggle toolbar.
  Set Shift-F12 to toggle menu bar.

  Colors:
                 Text: #CCCCCC
           Background: #140014
               Cursor: #00AA00
         Tab Activity: #FF0000
    Text Select color: #500032
            Bold Text: #FF5A00

  Columns = 76
  Rows = 18

GNOME-KEYRING:
  In the settings manager: Session and Startup, I checked -
    Certificate and Key Storage (GNOME Keyring: PKCS#11 Component)
    Secret Storage Service (GNOME Keyring: Secret Service)

  Originally I did not check
    SSH Key Agent (GNOME Keyring: SSH Agent)
  since I don't want SSH configurations to be dependent
  on the desktop GUI.  Subsequently checked.  All it
  does is store ssh passphases in gnome-keyring.  I don't
  use passphases in my encrypted SSH private keys because
  I trust gauss17's system admin.   ;-)

Claws E-mail:
  Easily stumbled through configuring Hover (Send/Receive) and
  local mail (Receive).  [Getting local mail working is another
  story for gauss17_AdminLog.txt.]

  To enable being able to view (not send) HTML e-mail, install the
  Fancy HTML plug-in:
    Configuration ->
      Plugins... ->
        Load -> Choose fancy.so

   To configure fancy:
     Configure ->
       Preferences... ->
         Plugins ->
           Fancy

   By default it will display as text.  When you click icon on RHS
   of email, everything (Pictures, Javascript, Java Apps, and
   pluggins open attachments have all been enabled by me -> so,
   only view HTML if you TRUST SENDER!)      

   Initially, explicitly enable the Address Keeper and S/MIME plugins.
   The S/MIME plugin brought in PGP/Core plugin which had me create
   a public/private key.

   S/MIME turns out to be IMPOSSIBLE to configure - what a mess.  So
   I disabled it and enabled PGP/Inline and PGP/MIME.
