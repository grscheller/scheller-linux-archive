# Private Home Page

## Used in lieu of browser bookmarks.

* This is an "old school" homepage but done in a "new school" way.
* Goal is to make a personal home page for my bookmarks
  and password schemas in a simple and clear cut way.
* I try and keep content (html) and style (css) as separate as
  possile.  HTML can be a snake pit of complexity, I endeavor
  to try to keep things as simple as possible.
* I use a variety of different browsers and don't want to have
  to "sync" my bookmarks and passwords between them on the various
  systems I use.
* After pushing these files to my various Linux and Windows systems,
  I just set my homepage in my browser to ~/info/Web/homepage.
* See the [linuxHome](../../linuxHome/) project to see how I push
  these Web pages out to my various Linux systems I use..

## Files:
### [homepage.html](homepage.html)
* Information content.
* Basically an HTML table organizing topics.
* Kept as simple as possible to facilitate monkey
  see - monkey do updating.
* Easily resized with Ctrl= and Ctrl-.
* CtrlShift+ and CtrlShift_ also work to resize.

### [homepage.html](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/grscheller/scheller-linux-archive/blob/master/info/Web/homepage.html)
* Same as above except rendered as HTML.

### style.css
* All formating done here.
* Optimize for my vision problems - dark background.

### [Portmanteau](Portmanteau.html)
* Contains password schemas I used
* Organized as a column table, which I am not happy with.
  I intend to change it to a row table since the "records"
  for each site are kept together.
