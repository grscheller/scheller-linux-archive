# Private Home Page

## Used in lieu of browser bookmarks.

* This is an "old school" homepage but done in a "new school" way.
* Goal is to make a personal home page for my bookmarks
  and password schemas in a simple and clear cut way.
* I try and keep content (html) and style (css) as separate as
  possile.  HTML can be a snake pit of complexity, I endeavor
  to try to keep things as simple as possible.
* I use a variety of different browsers and don't want to have
  to "sync" my bookmarks and passwords between them on the various
  systems I use.
* After pushing these files to my various Linux and Windows systems,
  I just set my homepage in my browser to ~/info/Web/homepage.
