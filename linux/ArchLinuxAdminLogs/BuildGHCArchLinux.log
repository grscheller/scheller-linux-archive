  Following the recipe found here: https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Newcomers

    $ cd ~/devel/build
    $ mkdir build_ghc
    $ cd build_ghc

  Started this build log file.

    $ git config --global url."git://github.com/ghc/packages-".insteadOf git://github.com/ghc/packages/

  This put some sort of url rewrite rule into ~/.gitconfig

    $ cd ghc
    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/ghc/ghc

  Created a repo which contains 34 sub repos.  Total distribution 540MB.

    $ cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk

  In mk/build.mk I uncommeted the line

    #BuildFlavour = devel2

  Continuing

    $ ./boot
    $ ./configure
    configure: error: Happy version 1.19.4 or later is required to compile GHC.

    $ pacman -Ss happy
    community/happy 1.19.8-2
        The Parser Generator for Haskell
    $ sudo pacman -Syu happy

    $ ./configure
    configure: error: Alex version 3.1.0 or later is required to compile GHC.

    $ pacman -Ss alex

    $ sudo pacman -Syu alex

    $ ./configure
  
  Succeeded, but missing HsColour.

    $ pacman -Ss HsColour

    $ sudo pacman -Syu haskell-hscolour

    $ ./configure

    Configure completed successfully.

       Building GHC version  : 8.5.20171208
              Git commit id  : 4335c07ca7e64624819b22644d7591853826bd75

       Build platform        : x86_64-unknown-linux
       Host platform         : x86_64-unknown-linux
       Target platform       : x86_64-unknown-linux

       Bootstrapping using   : /usr/bin/ghc
          which is version   : 8.2.2
    ...

  Since I have 4 hyperthreaded cores on my PC,

    $ make -j8

  and build immediately fails

    libraries/mtl/Control/Monad/Cont/Class.hs:52:8: error:
        Could not find module ‘Prelude’
        There are files missing in the ‘base-4.10.1.0’ package,
        try running 'ghc-pkg check'.
        Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
       |
    52 | module Control.Monad.Cont.Class (
       |  

  Something must be missing from Arch.  Running "ghc-pkg check" seems to be warning about haddock related
  issues.  Try installing ghc-static which has the Static Libraries and Documentation.

     $ sudo pacman -Syu ghc-static

  Now, after about a 1 GB less diskspace, build proceeds,

     $ make -j8

  Took about 20 minutes to build, lets try out our new toy by launching ghci:

     $ ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2 --interactive
     GHCi, version 8.5.20171208: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

     Prelude> foldl (+) 0 foo

     Leaving GHCi.
