#  Configure initial path, environment variables, 
#  aliases and shell functions which you want to be
#  able to change and be inherited, not reset, in 
#  child bash shells.
#
#  This was traditionally done in ~/.bash_profile,
#  when a login shell was created.  Unfortunately,
#  in a DE, the bash shells in terminal emulators
#  are descendent not from a login shell, but the
#  Bourne shell scripts which kick off the X-session.
#  As a result, only ~/.bashrc can be counted on to
#  be run.
#
#  Non-existent path and duplicate path elements
#  will be dealt with at the end of script.
