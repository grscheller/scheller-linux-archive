# Bash Environment Configuration
Documents how I configure my Linux/POSIX environments.
* Example Bash configuration files
* Simple, ~/bin bash scripts illustrating bash scripting techniques
* ~/.vim/vimrc configuration files (including Vundle and Syntastic)
* ~/.inputrc to configure GNU readline library
* ~/.xinitrc and ~/.xprofile files for X desktops
  - Note: These last two are POSIX shell scripts, not BASH

For these configuration files to fully work, the Bash
scripts in the [bin](bin) directory need to be put into
your ~/bin directory.

Scripts in the [util](util) directory are for particular
personal purposes and probably not of general interest.
