# Bash Environment Configuration

* Example ~/.bash*` configuration files
* Example ~/.xinitrc and ~/.xprofile files
* Nontrivial .vim/vimrc file with comments
* For these configuration files to fully work, the Bash
  scripts in the [bin](bin) directory need to be put into
  your ~/bin directory.
* Scripts in the [util](util) directory are for particular
  purposes for me and probably not of general interest.
