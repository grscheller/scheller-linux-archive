Installation:
  See notes in linux/ArchLinuxAdminLogs/ArchLinux_AdminLog dated
  2018-05-22 for steps I did to intall into Arch Linux.

Nomenclature: 
  Panels are toolbars that can live on borders of desktop
  Menu lives on a panel edge
  Launchers live on panals and launch programs
  Apps are GUI programs that run in desktop windows
  Applets are programs that run on a panel
    Can move applet on panel, or between panels, but
    only one instance across all panels.
  Desklets are programs that live directly on the desktop
    Take up too much valuable desktop real estate.
  System Tray is applet which shows other running applets

My layout:
  Two panels:
    Top panel:
      Menu (on LHS)
      Show desktop applet (iconizes everything)
      Launchers (to right of menu):
          Orage (XFCE) (launches to system tray)
          Clipman (XFCE) (launches to system tray)
          Claws Mail (single instance)
          Chrome
          XFCE Terminal
          Nemo file manager
      Workspace switcher applet (to left of system tray) 
      System tray (on RHS)
    Bottom panel:
      Window chooser applet

  Fonts:
      Monospace font: Monospace Bold 11
      All others:     Sans Bold 13

  Themes:
      Window borders:  Adapta-Nokto
      Icons:           gnome
      Controls:        Adwaita
      Mouse Pointer:   Adwaita
      Desktop:         Serena

      This combination gives very readable controls,
      light text on medium-dark-grey background.

      Can download themes from here:

  Windows:
    Menu -> Settings -> Windows -> Behavior
        Window focus mode:       sloppy (follows mouse)
        Auto raise on focus:     off
        Prevent focus stealing:  on

Autostarting applets:
  May need manually edit ~/.config/autostart Freedesktop.org files for this.
