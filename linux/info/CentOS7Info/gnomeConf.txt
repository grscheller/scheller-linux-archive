Purpose: Gnome 3 configuration on CentOS 7

GNOME Version:
  $ gnome-shell --version
  GNOME SHELL 3.25.4

Default Config:
  - Click-focus
  - Top menu bar MAC like, whatever window has focus, gnome
    put a tropdown menu as last item on left side.  This probable
    alone screws up any hope of mouse focus being usable.
  - Bottom menus bar acts as a toolbar program manager/window selection
    for current desktop.  Click far RHS to select desktop, four default
    desktops. 
  - Drag mouse to left side top menu, acts as desktop progam
    manager/window selector on current desktop.  Mouse wheel or click
    vertical menu bar on RHS to select desktop.  Something like
    docky in a LHS menu bar.  (Overview mode)
  - No functionality built into GUI to change focus model, info on
    internet using cmdline gconfigtool 5-6 years old.

UTF-8 right out of the box:
  $ echo $LANG
  en_US.UTF-8

GNOME Terminal configuration:
  Menu takes up minimal real estate, leave on.

  Edit -> Preferences -> Theme variant: Dark

Manually tern on Ethernet Interface:
  - Applet on right side top tool bar to left of sound applet

More behaviors:
  - super-tab to switch between windows on current desktop
  - super-L to lock screen
  - super (on key up) switches between the desktop and overview mode
