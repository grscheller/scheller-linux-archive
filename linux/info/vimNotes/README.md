# Vim - Vi iMproved
My purpose is to create a set of vim notes which
not only captures what I know, but can be used
as a tutorial.  Well, maybe more as a series of 
"cheatsheets" for vim.  I wanted to make each note
accessible to someone familiar the previous
notes above it.

* [Vim Factoids](vimFactoids.md)
* [Using Multiple Vim Windows](multipleVimWindows.md)
* [Regular Expresions](regExp.md)
