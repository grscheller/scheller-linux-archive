Vim - Vi improved

My go to text editor of choice is Vim.  What I want most
out of vim is the ability to edit text files in terminal
windows in a unicode aware way.  I want my editing
sessions to be CLI centric, but still integrate well
into the Linux GUI environment.

1. Minimalistic Configuration:

  Here is an example of a very simplistic ~/.vimrc file:

    syntax off
    set encoding=utf-8
    set fileencoding=utf-8
    set tabstop=4
    set shiftwidth=4
    set expandtab
    set mouse=

  The first line turns off program language syntax highlighting.  

  The next two lines make vim more unicode aware.

  The next 3 lines have the tab key put in 4 spaces, which is
  my default for C/C++ and Python.  For Haskell and Scala, I
  find typing 2 spaces easier than hitting the tab key once.

  Out-off-the-box on many Linux distributions, vim has been
  configured to hijack the mouse from the terminal emulator.
  This will cause the mouse to reposition the cursor.  This
  will be very familiar to Windows users, but this doesn't
  suit my "sloppy mouse focus" desktop style.  This is especially
  annoying because now I have to precisely position the cursor
  before pasting.  I can't highlight and paste from the editing
  session, nor summon the terminal emulator menu via a
  right-click, unless vim is in visual mode.  The last line
  in the above .vimrc file will prevents this.  

  While in vim, you can turn this mouse stealing behavior
  back on via,

    :set mouse=n

  My desktop gui environment is very old school.  I configure
  things to use "sloppy" mouse focus.  Also, I do not have 
  windows jump to the top of the Z-order just because they
  got the focus or received a mouse click.  Alt-click or
  lt-click-title_bar will bring the window to the top if I
  want.  Double-click title bar to make window full screen,
  middle-click title bar to drop window to the bottom of the
  Z-order.  This enables me to interact with vim in a small
  area of a terminal window while having another windows on
  top.  This is incredibly useful.  You are not constantly
  having to juggle windows around nor do you need two 42"
  monitors.

  In vim I find the Caps-Lock key annoying since it is easy to
  accidentally hit and commands like j or J do much different
  things.  Since this is much more annoying to me than the use
  case for Caps-Lock, I remap the key to be a second escape key.
  My left pinky is much happier.  This can be done through the
  Gnome-2 GUI configuration settings and in Xfce you can add

    xmodmap -e "clear Lock" -e "keysym Caps_Lock = Escape"

  to the Application Autostart section of Session and Startup
  of Settings.
