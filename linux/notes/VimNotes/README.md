# Vim - Vi iMproved
These notes have evolved from a text file cheatsheet
I maintained for myself.  I tried to put the MarkDown
files linked below in an order that only relies on  
the gist of the information in ones above it.
I have found the act of creating/maintaining these
notes invaluable in my journey to master Vim.

* [Basic text editing](basicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](vimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](advTradViCommands.md)
* [Using Multiple Vim Windows](multipleVimWindows.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](vimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](fileEncodingsAndUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](regExp.md)
* [Configuring Vim](vimrcConfigFile.md)

(TL;DR) <- Means "too long, don't read."  I use this to
mark interesting background information, but want to make
sure the reader knows it is clearly an aside.
