# linuxHome/info/Another

## Purpose:
This is an example directory to allow the script
[install_linuxHome](../../install_linuxHome)
to show what needs to be done when the ~/info directory
has some structure.

## Background:
It is simplified version of several such subdirectories I use at work.

In this case, it contains some utilities I share with non-technical
colleagues.
