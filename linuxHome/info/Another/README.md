# linuxHome/info/Another

## Purpose:
This is an example directory to allow the script<br>
"install_linuxHome" to show what needs to be done when<br>
an ~/info subdirectory has some structure.

## Background:
It is simplified version of several such subdirectories I use at work.

In this case, it contains some utilities I share with<br>
non-technical colleagues.
