# Example work homepage (Stub version)

I use a variety of different browsers and don't want to have to<br>
"sync" my book marks and passwords schemas between them.  I push<br>
these files to my various Linux systems and then just set my<br>
homepage in my browser to ~/info/Web/workHomepage.

## Files:
### [workHomepage.html](workHomepage.html)
* Information and links for work.
* Basically an HTML table organizing topics.
* Kept as simple as possible to facilitate monkey
  see - monkey do updating.
* Easily resized with Ctrl= and Ctrl-.
* CtrlShift+ and CtrlShift_ also work to resize.

### [homepage.html](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/grscheller/scheller-linux-archive/blob/master/linuxHome/info/Web/workHomepage.html)
* Same as above except rendered as HTML.

### [personalHomepage.html](personalHomepage.html)
* Personnal homepage.
* Linked from work version.
* Less trivial example can be found here [info/Web](../../../info/Web).

### [personalHomepage.html](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/grscheller/scheller-linux-archive/blob/master/linuxHome/info/Web/personalHomepage.html)
* Same as above except rendered as HTML.

### style.css
* All formating done here.
* Optimize for my vision problems - dark background.

### [Portmanteau](Portmanteau.html)
* Contains password schemas I used
* Organized as a column table, which I am not happy with.
  I intend to change it to a row table since the "records"
  for each site are kept together.

### [Portmanteau](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/grscheller/scheller-linux-archive/blob/master/linuxHome/info/Web/Portmanteau.html)
* Same as above except rendered as HTML.
