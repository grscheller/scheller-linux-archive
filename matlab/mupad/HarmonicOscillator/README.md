# MuPad

## Disclaimer:
I haven't had MuPad on my MATLAB license for at least 5 years,<br>
so I cannot vouch how well it will work for later versions of MuPad.

## MuPad Notebooks:
### HarmonicOscWaveFunctions.mn
* Models a 1-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator wave function.
* I was curious on how the it looks for high wave number.
