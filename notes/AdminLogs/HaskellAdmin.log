Purpose: For tracking Haskell infrastructure installed locally as
         an unprivalleged user.

  Configured Cabal to install Haskell Cabal packages into geoff
  home directory for Cabal packages not yet rolled into Arch
  Linux Pacman packages.

    $ mkdir -p .cabal/bin
    $ cabal update

  Installed codo-notation Cabal package

    $ cabal install codo-notation

    Cabal001: codo-notation

  Note: Cabal is "NOT" a true package manager.  Subsequent
    "cabal installs" can break previous ones.  This is known
    as "Cabal Hell."

    1. Cabal can install packages globally - NEVER DO THIS!!!
    2. Be prepared to blow away the .cabal directory and
       start over.
    3. Possible to do Cabal on a per project basis using Cabal
       sandboxws.  I wish to avoid this.  Also, periodically
       monitor if Arch Linux Repos pick up these Cabal packages.
    4. Like I did with Pacman, using "Cabal#:" so that I know
       what I have currently installed via Cabal.  Use

         $ grep 'Cabal...:' userland_Adminlog.txt

       to get the list of Cabal installs.  Starting the
       count at 001.

  Cabal man page says that it is "cabal - a system for building
  and packaging Haskell libraries and programs".

  Using stack as my build tool for Haskell -

  Installed into /usr/local/bin via.

    $ curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

  Install ghc locally to your home directory:

    $ stack setup

  Created a stack "sandbox" and using with git.

    $ stack --resolver ghc-7.10.3 new pythagTriples simple
    cd pythagTriples
    git init
    git add develLog.txt LICENSE Setup.hs pythagTriples.cabal
    git add stack.yaml src/Main.hs
    vi develLog.txt
    git status
    git commit

  Later, created a .gitignore file based on what was recommended
  by Chris Allen in 'https://www.howistart.org/posts/haskell/1'.

    $ cat .gitignore
    dist
    dist-*
    cabal-dev

  Run ghci outside of a project:

    $ stack ghci
    Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
    Using resolver: lts-7.1 from implicit global project's config file:
        /home/geoff/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml
    Configuring GHCi with the following packages:
    GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
    Loaded GHCi configuration from /tmp/ghci7977/ghci-script
    Prelude>

  Run another version of ghci outside of a project:

    $ stack --resolver ghc-7.10.3 ghci
    Run from outside a project, using implicit global project config
    Using resolver: ghc-7.10.3 specified on command line
    Configuring GHCi with the following packages:
    GHCi, version 7.10.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
    Prelude>

  OK, I need to figure out which version I should be using.  Seems
  that the lts-7.1 is using a newer version of GHCi than ghc-7.10.3!
  Until I am better "educated", I'll stick to lts-7.1.

2016-10-15 [Deprecated]:
  The latest long term support version of Haskell on Stackage,
  https://www.stackage.org/, is LTS Haskell 7.3 (ghc-8.0.1).  The
  defaults stack generates in stack.yaml are really out of date.
  The lts-3.5 on Arch Linux caused me a lot of confussion, but it
  did tell me that the only supported versions of ghc for OS
  key 'linux64-ncurses6' are GhcVersion 7.10.3, GhcVersion 8.0.1.

  So, I'll stick with lts-7.3 until the next LTS release.

  Globally I installed lts-7.3 via

    $ stack --resolver lts-7.3 setup

  and made lts-7.3 the default  by editing
  ~/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml, where the non-comment
  contents of this file are now:

    extra-package-dbs: []
    packages: []
    extra-deps: []
    resolver: lts-7.3

  Now, a comment in this file directs me to the file
  ~/.stack/config.yaml as being the default template for
  new projects.  This file refers to the website
  http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/yaml_configuration/
  for how to configure this file.  After consulting this
  website, the contents of ~/.stack/config.yaml are now:

    templates:
      params:
        author-email: geoffrey@scheller.com
        author-name: 'Geoffrey Scheller'
        copyright: 'Copyright: (c) 2016 Geoffrey R. Scheller'
        github-username: grscheller

  I left the param 'category: value' off until I understand
  it better.  Seems that it should be set on a per project
  basis anyway.

2016-10-15 [Deprecated]:
  When creating a new stack project, use

    $ stack new foofoo new-template

  This will create:
    LICENSE
    Setup.hs
    foofoo.cabal
    stack.yaml
    app/Main.hs
    src/Lib.hs
    test/Spec.hs

  This seems a much better starting point than the ones I
  fumbled to create above.

  Aside: Don't know why it put it in the Web category?

2016-10-16 [Deprecated]:
  Seems that the Haskell/Stack world has moved onto lts-7.4.

  I saw this when I tried to build something with stack.

  Updated stack itself:

    $ stack update

2016-10-20 [Deprecated]:
  Updated stack to use lts-7.4 when outside a project:

  Changed

    resolver: lts-7.3

  in ~/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml

2017-01-29:
  I had noticed that some package (I think haskell-cmark)
  required ghc 8.0.1-1 as a dependency.  Also noticed that
  the version of stack in the Arch Repos was later than
  the one I previous installed in /usr/local.

  Removed previous stack Haskell infrastructure.

    $ rm -rf ~/.stack
    $ rm ~/.local/bin/{cabal,happy,alex}
    # rm /usr/local/bin/stack

  Installed stack and haskell-stack packages with
  pacman.  Initialized new sandbox into my home
  directory.

    $ stack setup

  and created a new project with

    $ stack new junkTest simple

  From the stack.yaml file, I see the following

    resolver: lts-7.18
    # require-stack-version: ">=1.3"

  Also,

    $ whence ghc
    /usr/bin/ghc

    $ stack exec whence ghc
    /home/geoff/.stack/programs/x86_64-linux/ghc-ncurses6-8.0.1/bin/ghc
    /usr/bin/ghc

  Running stack the first time created a default YAML file

    ~/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml

  With the following non-comment content:

    flags: {}
    extra-package-dbs: []
    packages: []
    extra-deps: []
    resolver: lts-7.18

  Versions of ghc

    $ /usr/bin/ghc --version
    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.0.1

    $ ~/.stack/programs/x86_64-linux/ghc-ncurses6-8.0.1/bin/ghc --version
    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.0.1

  Finally I editted the file

    ~/.stack/config.yaml

  as follows

    templates:
      params:
        author-name: geoffrey@scheller.com
        author-email: 'Geoffrey Scheller'
        copyright: 'Copyright: (c) 2017 Geoffrey R. Scheller'
        github-username: grscheller
        category: 'Learning Haskell'

  From these sites:

    https://docs.haskellstack.org
    https://haskell-lang.org/tutorial/stack-build

  I got the following:

    We define project to mean a directory that contains a
    stack.yaml file, which specifies how to build a set of
    cabal packages.  We define package to be a package with
    a .cabal file.

    A cabal package is identified by a single .cabal file, and
    has 0 or 1 libraries, and 0 or more executables, test suites,
    and benchmarks.

    A Stack project has 1 or more cabal packages, and can build
    them all at the same time.

  Initialize a new project with

    $ stack new junkTest simple

  Build the project with

    $ stack build

  Test the project with

    $ stack test

  Install the project with

    $ stack install

    For the simple project, this just installs
    the executable into ~/.local/bin

  An existing Cabal package can be initialize
  a stack.yaml file to use Stack via

    $ stack init

  inside the directory with the package's .cabal file.
  Stack will attempt to determine a package set compatible
  with the packages requested in the .cabal file.

  To get all sorts of configuration info, use

    $ stack path

  To find out the versions of libraries which stack installed

    $ stack list-dependencies
    base 4.9.0.0
    junkTest3 0.1.0.0

2017-02-01:
  Installed networking components.

    Pacman: python2-iwscan python2-wpactrl

  Noticed following warnings in /var/log/wicd/wicd.log -

  At several wifi hotspots, not all, I've had to configure static IP addresses.

2018-02-07:
  Time to figure out the Arch Haskell infarstucture.

  Up to now, I have used Stack which pretty much ignored the existing
  Arch Haskell infrastructure.  When using ghc from the command line, it failed
  to link due to the absence of the Haskell static libraries.  Instead of
  linking dynamically, I installed the static libraries via the ghc-static
  package.

  Cabal is the package description format for Haskell.  It describes a package
  and how it interacts with the language.  It provides a common infrastructure
  for building and distributing packages.  The cabal-install build tool provides
  dependency resolution and retrieves source packages from Hackage, the official
  Haskell package hosting website.  Cabal uses the GHC that you indicate; it is
  beyond its scope to manage GHC installations.

  Stack is a build system for Haskell.  Its aim is to provide extremely
  reprodicible builds.  To do this, it freezes all your dependencies, including
  the version of GHC used for the project.  It utilizes the Stackage package
  website.  Stackage contains snapshots of packages and GHC compilers which
  are compatible with each other.  When starting a project, you choose which
  Stackage snapshot to use.  It downloads and installs locally into your
  home directory which versions of GHC and other packages it needs to build
  your project.  It is built on top of Cabal and replaces cabal-install.

  My Arch Haskell infrastructure is not a Stackage snapshot.  I need to
  learn how to use Cabal directly.  This will also help me learn how to
  use stack better.

2018-02-07:
  First step is to uninstall the Haskell static libraries.  When I did 
  this (see ArchLinux_AdminLog.txt), it also uninstalled ghc!

  What I build locally to run on Arch, I'll use cabal-install with sandboxes
  and dynamic linking.  I'll use stack when I want a statically linked 
  executable I can distribute, or share a build.

  Lets see how much of the Haskell Platform I have left:

    $ pacman -Qs happy

  I guess I never installed the pacman cabal-install package.

    $ sudo pacman -Syu ghc
    $ sudo pacman -Syu cabal-install

  The ghc-static package was not re-installed.

  The cabal-install package contained the /usr/bin/cabal command:

    $ whence cabal*
    /usr/bin/cabal

  The 'cabal help' command gives a summary of the available cabal commands.

    $ cabal update

    module Main where

    main :: IO ()
    main = putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"

  Need to tell cabal to use dynamic libraries for my sandbox.

    $ cabal configure --disable-library-vanilla --enable-shared --enable-executable-dynamic

  Clean things up,

    $ cabal clean

  this deleted the executable and undid the 'cabal configure'.  Redoing
  these and finally,
