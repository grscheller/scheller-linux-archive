#  This was traditionally done in .bash_profile
#  whenever a login shell was created.  Unfortunately,
#  in most Desktop Environments, the bash shells
#  in terminal emulators inherit not from a login
#  shell, but the POSIX shell scripts which kick off
#  the X-session.  As a result, only ~/.bashrc can
#  be counted on to be consistently run.
