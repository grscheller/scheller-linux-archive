## Bash Environment Configuration
Configure files and associated scripts to bootstrap
my Linux/POSIX environments.
* Example Bash and other Linux configuration files
* Useful ~/bin Bash scripts
* Vim configuration

For these configuration files to fully work, the Bash
scripts in the [bin](bin) directory need to be put into
your ~/bin directory.

Scripts in the [util](util) directory are for particular
personal purposes and probably not of general interest.
