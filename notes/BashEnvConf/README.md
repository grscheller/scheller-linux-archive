## Bash Environment Configuration
Configuration files and associated scripts to bootstrap
my Linux/UNIX/POSIX Bash environments.
* Bash startup scripts
* Useful ~/bin Bash scripts
* Vim configuration
* BashEnvConf/installHome installs everything into $HOME
* Tested on:
  * Arch Linux
  * CentOS 7
  * Cygwin on Windows 10

For these configuration files to fully work, the Bash
scripts in the [bin](bin) directory need to be put into
the ~/bin directory.

Scripts in the [util](util) directory are for particular
personal purposes and probably not of general interest.
