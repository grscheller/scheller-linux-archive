1. Heads and Tails:

   Prints first 5 lines of Filename or stdin if Filename omitted.

     $ head -5 Filename

   Does same thing.

     $ head -n 5 Filename

   Prints all but the last 5 lines of Filename.

     $ head -n -5 Filename

   Note: tail is similar but not quite dual,

     $ tail -n 2 Filename
     $ tail -n -2 Filename

   both print out the last 2 lines of Filename.

   Prints out last 3 lines of Filename after last 5 lines have
   been stripped off.

     $ head -n -5 Filename | tail -n 3

2. Find files with find:

   Find files in all subdirectories with the name junk in them

     $ find . -name '*junk*' -print
   
   Most modern Unixes don't need the -print option.

   Useful when dealing with files with whitespace in their names,
   these GNU extensions, -print0 for find and -0 for xargs,
   use NUL as the record terminator for file names.

     $ find .config/ -name '* *' -print0 | xargs -0 -- ls -d

   The above command finds all files with a space in the file name.
   Also, the -- option in GNU based commands mark the end of
   command line option.  So above -d is associated with the
   ls command and causes ls to print directory names, not directory
   contents.

3. grep:

4. sed:

5. awk (minimal subset):

6: xargs and $(...)
