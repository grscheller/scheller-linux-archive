  * (Lao Tzu)

  * (Francis Bacon)

  * (Marc MacYoung)
* Understand the difference between social, asocial, and interpersonal violence.
* Martial (Combative) Arts are more about self-improvement than fighting.
* Over a long time, the serious student of the martial arts will have many different tools which can be applied to a violent situation, most of which can be used to their highest advantage to deescalate the situation. By tools I don't just mean techniques.
* If someone is really intent on killing you, and they have half a brain, there really is nothing you can do about it.
* When falling relax. While the Earth is yin and the Heavens are yang, the Earth is so big that the small amount of yang it contains vastly exceeds your yang-ness. Meet the Earth with yang, she will slap you back. Meet the earth with yin, she will embrace you and help you up. Learn how to fall.
* Violence is the most toxic environment known to mankind. The non-macho, calm, practical, rational stuff is way more appealing because it keeps you out of that hell. Don't let fear, emotion, or pride cast you into it.
  * (Marc MacYoung/Dave Grossman - Paraphraised)
* Yin and Yang are adjectives. So "contains" must mean "embodies".
* Anger is a short madness (insanity).
  * (Horace)

  * (Peter Lorge - Classical Chinese military historian)
* Lords Prayer: Heavenly Father, holy is Your name. Your Kingdom come, Your will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses, and help us to forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

  * (Mark 12:29-31)
* Self-defense is about preparation for, avoidance of, and deescalation of violent situations. Combat has to do with prevailing in violence. Warfare involves both in political and logistical contexts.
* Supernormal accomplishment is not supernatural, that's why it is called gungfu, literally, "skill achieved through persistent effort."
  * (Lee Scheele)
* Martial Arts can be applied to combat, competition, health, self-improvement (physical, mental, social); but why do I do it? Because it is fun.
* Neither self-defense nor combat are about the fair fight. Competition can be a tool to help develop a Martial Art and safely practice it; but it can also lead you astray, especially if the rules are used to manipulate the outcome.
* No pain, no pain.
  * (Sifu Dug Corpolongo)
* Don't confuse nice with good, nor crass with bad. Not judgmental does not necessarily mean good, nor does judgmental mean bad. The most closed minded people I have ever known were quite non-judgmental, except against those they perceive as judgmental. The Hypocrites are just those who fail to judge themselves.
* Brave good people are a blessing. Craven bad people will tend to stay out of your way, if you remain alert and have clean hands. Cowardly good people are more dangerous than brave bad people. The former are ruled by emotion and cannot be reasoned with; the later may succumb to selfish desires, but at least are fairly predictable and usually can be reasoned with.
* Just because I am opinionated does not mean I am not open minded. 
* Don't be an enabler for evil, stand up and tell the truth.
* The Art of being Judgmental: Temper your judgment of others with empathy, and don't forget to judge yourself. Don't forget to forgive yourself either. When judged, appreciate the feedback.
* Throwing an opponent is all about letting/getting them to commit to a step, and blocking or overextending it. It also helps to get out of the way.
* You can not forgive a debt someone owes to another.
* Forgiveness is as much for yourself as it is for the one you forgive. 
* I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one of the other! So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
  * (Revelation 3:15-16 John's letter to the Church of Laodicea)
* When events don't seem to make sense, follow the money.
* I have striven not to laugh at human actions, not to weep at them, not to hate them, but to understand them.
  * (Baruch Spinozo - 1676)
* Selflessness is not necessarily a virtue; selfishness is not necessary a vice. It all depends where you put your empathy and logic.
* The Political Cycle: Bondage -> Revolution -> Liberty -> Complacency-> Apathy -> Bondage
* Society is better off when the techies are either off doing their own agendas or employed by business men. Less so when employed as civil servants or by the military. Society is totally screwed when the techies are tools of politicians. 
* Techies were gainfully employed throughout the dark ages, helping one warlord to lay siege to another warlord's cities and castles. They got quite good building siege engines, trebuchets, sapper tunnels, and later cannons. 
* Government naturally gravitates toward corruption.
* Simplicity cannot be contrived, it must come about naturally.

  * (Matsuo Bassho)
* Throughout a technique every moment should be like the beginning of a technique.
  * (Prof. Tom Hill)
* The sanest man sets up no deed, lays down no law, takes everything that happens as it comes, as something to animate, not appropriate, to earn, not to own, to accept naturally without self-importance: If you never assume importance you never lose it.
  * (Lao Tzu)
* Ego and preconceived notions limit what one can learn.
* Beware the math-phoebe, for they may be more than someone who is just intimidated by mathematics or scared to be perceived as stupid. They may be a math-sogamist who would rather die than think mathematically, or even logically. Either of these should not be confused with those who think they hate mathematics but actually were just turned off by the rote learning approaches of non-mathematically language oriented elementary school teachers. Some of these later types can be quite mathematically gifted.
* The power to guess the unseen from the seen, to trace the implications of things, to judge the whole piece by the pattern, the condition of feeling life in general so completely that you are well on your way to knowing any particular corner of it - this cluster of gifts may almost be said to constitute experience.
  * (Henry James)
* No society is guaranteed perpetual existence.
* In any sort of competition, always act as if you are behind. Be mindful of who your true competitors and allies are. Know the agenda of the referees and whose side they are on; possibly they are your true competitors, and your opponents your allies. Know the rules and how to either break them or use them. A winner does not always need a loser, and sometimes there are just losers. You define your goals and what winning means to you. Don't win just to win, win to accomplish your goals. Don't confuse winning with not losing. Choose your battles carefully, and cheerfully concede that which does not matter. For whatever reason, if you let someone win, don't let them know. People with no skin in the game tend to be helpful, especially if they see you as neither arrogant nor a threat, and you show them respect.
* When a society collapses, it is not pretty. It breeds lawlessness and tyranny. People are afraid to do good, rationalize their bad behavior, and look for scapegoats. While the social network is crumbling and collapsing, it is usually still being expanded.
* In War, Victory should be swift. If victory is slow men tire, morale sags, sieges exhaust strength; protracted campaigns strain the public treasury ... I have heard that in war haste can be folly but have never seen delay that was wise.
  * (Sun Tzu)
* No society is guaranteed perpetual existence.
* It is very difficult to simultaneously walk two roads at the same time. This does not mean one cannot explore another path for a while and return to pick up the original trail where one left off, with new perspectives and fresh eyes. When going down a new or old road, one must be willing to lay aside one's preconceived notions but still be able to recognize old friends.
* Those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.
  * (Frederick Douglass)
* We do not seek to imitate the masters; rather we seek what they sought.
  * (Matsuo Basho)
* The most perfect technique is that which is not noticed at all.
  * (Pablo Casals)
* Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
  * (Antoine de St. Exupery)
* One night a thief breaks in to rob the modest hobble of an old Buddhist (or Taoist) monk. There he finds nothing of value and is disgusted. At that moment rhe monk returns. the thief is embarrassed but the monk removes his clothes and along with his walking stick insists the thief take them. The thief is troubled but leaves reluctantly with the items. After the thief has left the monk gazes lovingly at a beautiful moon. The monk sighs and says, “I could have given him that too”.
  * (Sifu Dug Corpolongo)

* Theory will take you only so far.
  * (Ernest Lawrence )
* When they’ve punished you enough, they’ll serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, and pat you in the back telling all is forgiven. Just remember, it won’t be for you… it would be for them.

* "Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability"
  * Edsger W. Dijkstra
* Don't confuse "Simple" with "Easy" - they are different. The latter is usually at the expence of the former.
* Having tests should not encourage someone to change code without being careful.
  * Rich Hickey
* Simplicity is a choice. We have a culture of complexity. Avoid tools, languages, constructs, etc. that generate complex outputs. Simple != easy. Look for complexity and avoid it. Reliability tools: testing, refactoring, and type systems are good but secondary. They do not enforce simplicity. They are just a safety net.
  * Rich Hickey
* The real power of a data structure comes not from what it enables you to do, but from what it prevents you from doing.
* An object oriented programmer is someone who cannot define the word "function" without using the word "method" to do so.
