## Private Home Page
Old fashioned personal home page.  Used in lieu
of browser bookmarks.  Homepage available anywhere
I can clone my repo.  Set homepage in browser to
`<path-to-git-clone>/web/homepage`.

### [homepage.html](homepage.html)
Information content kept here.  Basically an HTML table
of organized topics.  Kept very simple to facilitate
"monkey see-monkey do" updating.

### [style.css](style.css)
All style formating done here.
